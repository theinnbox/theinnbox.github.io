&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Tucked into an unassuming alley in Lijiang's quieter and less popular ancient town, Shuhe, is a tranquil, homey, and harmonious little guest house with the most adorable name: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/my-love-inn.html?aid=1452227&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;My Love Inn.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Blink and you might miss the entrance as I did. The wooden entryway frames a large potted plant against a white backdrop, almost like a piece of art. In addition to starting our stay with a little bit of ambiance, the obscured entrance also provides a sense of privacy. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in an open air courtyard surrounded by wooden slats, ceramic pots, and a shallow pool of water that's home to a handful of tranquil koi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/myloveinn/4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Upon check in we were treated to a tea ceremony inside the lobby— which is less like a traditional hotel lobby and more like a minimalist dining room fit with a long wooden table for entertaining. The tea break was a much appreciated opportunity to catch our breath after pulling our luggage through Shuhe's cobblestone streets (where cars are not permitted). We learned that My Love Inn is, like most guest houses in Lijiang, a family run affair. The dream and vision of a matriarch whose son is now responsible for daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Rooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We were offered a free upgrade to the &quot;superior twin room&quot;. The main difference between that and our originally booked twin room is that it's slightly bigger and has an divider between the seating area and the beds. The divider between the two areas was actually very useful because the entrance to our room opened up into the courtyard. If we wanted to enjoy the daylight and a fresh breeze we could keep the door to our room open while still maintaing privacy behind the divider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The beds were super comfortable and came with electric blankets, which was sooo nice since Shuhe is near a mountainous area and tends to get cold at night. The rooms also come with fluffy robes and free cozy slippers with &quot;My Love&quot; embroidered on them in Chinese (which I took with me and still use at home). I'm pretty sure even without an upgrade we would have enjoyed our original room (the cheapest option at the inn), although if I were ever back in Lijiang I would go ahead and splurge for the Deluxe Family Room on the second floor which looks like the best suite in the joint with its huge glass windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The bathrooms were quite modern in contrast to all the wooden furniture and interiors. The fixtures and appliances were all by Moen or Kohler so, ya know, they got those quality American bathroom products. The bathrooms also have heated tile floors and our room had an enclosed standing shower (some rooms have tubs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The only room for improvement here is that the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a sliding wooden door (like all the doors at the inn). Our door didn't really slide to a snug close which gave me a little bit of anxiety, and it wasn't really soundproof. I would probably for-go the aesthetically consistent choice for a normal hinged door that locks. That said, the sliding door was still an improvement over the other hotel we stayed at in Lijiang where the bathroom was separated by a hanging piece of fabric!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I can't speak highly enough about the service at My Love Inn. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel at home. During our stay my mom got a headache and asked the staff if they had any pain relievers she could buy. They didn't, but a member of the staff personally escorted us to the nearest pharmacy so that she could help my mom translate and pick out the right medication, as well as pay for it. Likewise they were also very hands on in helping us coordinate excursions we had booked outside of the hotel. For context, I speak ~zero~ Chinese and my mom's is very limited from her early childhood growing up in China. The staff were so helpful in coordinating w/ local tour agencies on our behalf and also escorting us to the right pick up areas since vehicles are not allowed in the immediate area around the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/myloveinn/9.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Upon check out they gave us each a parting gift— a box of black sugar, a local specialty which we had seen in various shops around Lijiang. I'm a sucker for foodie gifts— I mean these are the type of things it's hard to justify buying for yourself but make such good presents. I can't say if this is a normal occurrence though or if they just really liked my mom who managed to endear herself to everyone on staff. Either way, it was a great way to end our stay at both the inn and in Lijiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Free breakfast is included daily at My Love Inn and it does not disappoint. The atmosphere and offerings are less continental-breakfast-buffet and more like eating breakfast at a cute cafe, which is actually a cozy sun-dappled room in the inn's entryway. The first night we had heart-shaped fried eggs (adorable!) and congee. The second day they offered us breakfast noodles in a fresh, tomato-y broth that was surprisingly light and clean to the taste. Breakfast also comes with warm soy milk or tea/coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb4&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Shuhe is like the Brooklyn to Lijiang's Manhattan. While both are distinguished as &quot;ancient towns&quot;, Shuhe is a little smaller and slower in pace— with wider streets that are far less packed than Lijiang Ancient Town. Instead of chain boutique pastry stores you'll find independent owned fruit carts lining the streets. On the flip side, the dining options are so much more varied in Lijiang Ancient Town. For dinner the majority of restaurants in Shuhe do Hot Pot (which is great! Just maybe not for every meal). Muzi restaurant, located on the edge of town, was a welcome way to change it up with a more diverse menu focused around vegetables. The fare is literal farm-to-table as the restaurant is located across the street from their farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
For this trip I spent half my time in Lijiang Ancient Town and half in Shuhe Ancient Town, though it's more common to stay in one of the ancient towns and do a day trip to the other. Based on the quality of My Love Inn compared to the hotels in Lijiang Ancient Town and Shuhe's relative chill factor, I'd recommend staying there and then day-tripping to Lijiang Ancient Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While most of the rooms are located on the ground floor, access to My Love Inn requires walking and carrying luggage across a few unpaved streets, with many wooden thresholds, which may be inconvenient for wheelchair users or anyone with difficulty walking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I highly recommend staying at the My Love Inn if you ever find yourself in Lijiang. It's been one of the best hotel experiences I've had, at such a humble little place for such a reasonable price.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know— Valentine’s Day is a manufactured event intended to sell Hallmark cards and chocolate with no real bearing on the health of our relationships. But the fact it falls pretty squarely in the midst of our winter hibernation always makes me excited for an excuse to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, literally &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; out of the ordinary, whether that’s dressing up for a fancy dinner or packing my bags for a weekend escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find it interesting the ways in which traveling can strengthen our relationships, or at least put them to the test. Whether that’s through spending a longer stretch of time than usual with our significant others and friends, working together to navigate an unfamiliar place, or learning more about yourself and what you’re capable of on a solo-trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve put together some low-key ideas on how to celebrate, regardless of your relationship status. Fun fact: I’ve probably spent more of the past five Valentine’s Days with my best friend than my boyfriend— there’s really no wrong way to spend it and to be honest nothing sounds more romantic to me than exploring a new city where nobody knows your name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 light-silver i mb0&quot;&gt;As of writing all of the hotels recommended still have availability for the night of February 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minimal yet warm Airbnb in Salt Lake City is perfectly located and walking distance to downtown and many of the city’s major attractions. Stroll around Temple Square, load up on cheap and delicious diner food at Ruth’s, and of course visit the namesake lake. The weather during Valentine’s week is projected to be in the high 40s/low 50s and JetBlue offers flights from Long Beach to SLC starting at $53 each way and $78 from SFO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adorable little Bavarian town in eastern Washington looks straight out of a storybook. It’s a two hour drive from Seattle and this modern, custom-built Airbnb was only just completed last year. The Airbnb is perfect for a cabin weekend with a group of friends, close to the town for shopping and dining but also with access to nearby ski resorts and hiking trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a 45 minute drive up from Pacific Coast Highway from L.A. lies the newly re-opened Native Hotel, a series of bungalows formally known as the Malibu Riviera Motel where old Hollywood types like James Dean and Marilyn Monroe wood often escape to. Get in your prerequisite long walks on the beach, brunch at Malibu Farm Cafe, and get your fill of some of the region’s best wines before closing out the night in your coastal abode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located around the corner from the Country Music Fall of Hame, SoBro Guest House is an all-suite hotel in which each of the 24 rooms come complete with a modern kitchen and living area. Take in a show at the Grand Ol’ Opry and if you’re feeling up for it, take a 20 minute Uber ride outside of town to try the homemade biscuits at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovelesscafe.com/&quot;&gt;Loveless Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Round-trip flights to Nashville from Dallas are as low as $91 if you’re flexible enough to fly back on Valentine’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a little girl growing up in Texas, the San Antonio riverwalk seemed like the most romantic place in the world. Take a night-time cruise amidst rainbow colored lights and then spend your nights at the historic Hotel Havana, originally opened in 1918 by a local groper and recently reopened under the management of the Austin based hotel group Bunkhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A three hour drive/one hour flight east of Chicago is a little town called Galena, with a big Irish influence and the former home of Ulysses S. Grant. The main street is filled with adorable little shops, restaurants, and distilleries. We recommend staying a 20 minute drive across stay lines in Dubuque, Iowa, at The Richards House, a budget friendly bed &amp;amp; breakfast that has all the magic of a Hogwarts common room.&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily the Alma Hotel is situated right above its namesake Restaurant and Cafe so with the wonders of room service you don’t even have to leave your love nest if you don’t want to. Round trip flights from Chicago are as low as $74 on Spirit airlines.&lt;/p&gt;

Brush up on your American history at historical sites like Ben Franklin’s house and the Liberty Bell and then treat yourself to all American eats like burgers at High Street on Market or fried chicken and donuts from Federal Donuts. All before falling into bed at this adorable row-house in Rittenhouse Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bariloche is full of dualities— considered the gateway to Argentinian Patagonia, this magical land of lakes is equally enchanting in either summer or winter weather. It’s famous vistas include both the high altitudes of the surrounding Andes and the low lakes in-between them. Much like Buenos Aires, Bariloche also has a distinctly European influence— except instead of Parisian architecture you’ll find Swiss style chalets alongside many fondue and chocolate shops. In fact, Bariloche is considered the chocolate capital of the country. If your idea of the perfect vacation involves both breathtaking views and eating copious amounts of high quality food, then Bariloche is the perfect place for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f2 mt5 mb0&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Where to Stay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc f6 light-silver i mb4&quot;&gt;Rates are based on a one-night search for February 2018. Remember: Bariloche is south of the equator and experiences opposite seasons to the U.S.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cursory search into where to stay in Bariloche will introduce you to Llao Llao, the big game in town and surprisingly the only one that’s really talked about. I won’t begrudge anyone their preference for luxury but personally I’ve never been a big resort person— for both the price point and how isolated they can feel from the very place you’ve come to experience. So you won’t find many recommendations for resorts here, and I bring it up in regards to Bariloche because I think it’s a shame. There are so many interesting places to stay that capture the spirit of the region. Let’s give them some recognition, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For solo travelers &amp;amp; the budget conscious — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostel41below.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;41 Below Hostel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $26/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41 Below is an unpretentious and charming hostel run by some friendly Kiwis. It’s also probably the best value you’re going to find in Bariloche because of its proximity to downtown, the jumping off point for many excursions in the region. It’s also convenient for solo-travelers because it’s very easy to meet fellow travelers in the hostel lounge and pair up to split excursion costs. I’ll admit just like I’m not a huge resort person, I’m also not a huge hostel person. I’m always a bit concerned there might be too much of a party vibe which is not what I’m looking for these days, but 41 Below was extremely chill, at least when I stayed there in the winter season. It’s not so youthful that you’ll feel out of place if you’re not a student, but I would say that someone in their late 40s might be less likely to find company of a similar age. And look, while 41 Below is probably not going to win any design awards anytime soon, for a hostel at this price range the decor is charmingly simple and sufficiently tasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;We would not recommend 41 Below for guests with wheelchairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sunny cabin is located just a little ways off from downtown, which is accessible via a 15 minute bus ride from the nearby stop. In a refreshing twist the bed is actually located on the main floor instead of the loft, which has been instead converted into an office-like space. The modern bathroom also looks newer and nicer than what you’ll find at many hotels in the area. The cabin sits on private property that the host’s parents live on, who are also available as a helpful point of contact for guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;We don't recommend this airbnb for wheelchair users. In addition it's been noted that the bed may be small for any exceptionally tall guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout of this cabin is perfect for families traveling with small children, and also for anyone who prefers being a little farther removed from the more tourist-centric downtown areas. It’s like being in a tent but with indoor plumbing and sturdy walls. Wake up to scenic views of the surrounding mountain and lakes, one of which is only a twenty minute walk away for a summer swim. Because of its more rural location, you’ll definitely want to rent a car when staying here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Portuguese architect who goes by Nuno is literally slaying the Bariloche Airbnb game. He manages 23 listings across the region varying from $65 to $412 a night, and all of which are impeccably designed and decorated. Our favorite of the bunch is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11521531?s=-250liCw&quot;&gt;this 6 bedroom, centrally located home&lt;/a&gt; which embodies all of our modern farmhouse dreams for an extremely reasonable $115/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the on-the-nose name. The main selling point of this lodge are the circular jacuzzi tubs overlooking the lake— but hey, even the rooms with the boring ol’ rectangular tubs look just as amazing. We’re recommending this one for winter travel. If it’s too cold to do anything outside then get you some champagne and bubble bath and treat-yo-self. This one’s also got a great location just far enough outside the hustle and bustle of touristy downtown but still close enough for it to be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Design Suites does have an elevator on the premises but we recommend directly confirming with the hotel that they have facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peninsula Petit boasts world class service for a reasonable price. It’s one of the more remotely located places we’re recommending, a ways off from downtown but the hotel makes up for it by providing everything you need right at home. For starters, people &lt;i&gt;rave&lt;/i&gt; about the on-site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g312848-d7376546-Reviews-Desde_El_Sur-San_Carlos_de_Bariloche_Province_of_Rio_Negro_Patagonia.html&quot;&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; and its breakfast in particular. The premises also include a private, pup-friendly beach for guests, and we hear the hands-on owner also lends out his kayak to guests for free. Peninsula Petit is often fully booked so this is definitely a place you want to book far in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Peninsula Petit offers facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, their most affordable offering is a triple room that when fully occupied comes to a reasonable $60 a person. This lodge looks straight out of a fairytale and I’m sure a record number of proposals have gone down here. Breakfast is included and keep in mind that the intimate little hotel’s twelve rooms go fast, so book in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only have a day in Bariloche, this is probably the first thing I’d recommend doing. A steep hour’s hike to the top of Cerro Campanario gives you a breathtaking panoramic view of the entire surrounding region. I still think back on this trip and this specific hike as one of the most stunning glimpses of nature I’ve witnessed. At the top you can also ride the chairlift back down to the base of the mountain. Technically you can ride it up too, but where’s the fun in that? Getting to Cerro Companario is also easy and very affordable by bus and the hike itself is straightforward— so skip the $$$ on a private tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind this cute little red storefront is a cheese lover's paradise. La Marmite specializes in swiss-style fondue and each order is enough for 2-3 people and comes with meats, vegetables, and bread accompaniements to dip. They also offer chocolate fondue for dessert. Locals seem torn on the price: depending on who you ask this is either one of the cheaper places to get fondue in Bariloche, or one of the more expensive!

&lt;p&gt;Lake Nahuel Huapi is the big lake which Bariloche sits on the south coast. The lake has seven branches, most of which were carved out by glaciers back in the day. Boat tours are available daily— we easily booked one through the hostel we were staying at, but there is also a tourist center downtown from which you can book tours as well. The best part of the boat tour was seeing just how gargantuan the Andes are when viewed at sea level, compared to being viewed from afar at Cerro Campanario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As mentioned earlier, Bariloche is the chocolate capital of Argentina. The two big players in town are &lt;a href=&quot;http://chocolatesrapanui.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Rapa Nui&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like an offshoot of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamuschka.com/&quot;&gt;Mamushka&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like the inside of a set of Russian nesting dolls. Both also function as an ice cream shop and are a great place to pick up gifts to take home, although I slightly preferred Rapa Nui because they had a larger variety of food products for sale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest regrets from my trip is NOT going skiing in Bariloche. I didn't know how to back then and I got intimidated about the idea of learning in a foreign country. But if skiing is your &lt;i&gt;thang&lt;/i&gt;, Cerro Catedral is apparently where everyone goes to catch some air. Lift tickets cost around $25 and in addition to skiing Catedral also offers snow tubing (called &quot;donuts&quot; there), sleding, snow shoes, along with &quot;Snow BMX&quot; and &quot;Snow Scoot&quot;, both of which are not helping my FOMO.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antares is the most popular of many local breweries in Bariloche. You can get a tasting flight of four different beers for around $7, the most popular of which is their honey beer. It's a welcome break from all the Quilmes you'll be drinking the rest of your time in Argentina. And while Antares is also a gastropub, we recommend sticking to the drinks here— there are better places to eat in Bariloche!

&lt;p&gt;
Puerto Blest is a tiny but scenic port near the border to Chile, and a popular stop on many of the boat tours in the area. If you don't have a Chilean visa, tbh the little port is going to seem very small and boring. If you do, it's going to open up a whole new world. You can explore parts of the area across the border, or like many people, actually leave Argentina and enter Chilean patagonia through this point.

&lt;p&gt;I'm just going to come out and say it— Asheville is a hipster haven. There are microbreweries, art galleries, and new american gastropubs a plenty— but perhaps it's the fact that they've been doing this for ages (most residents would identify as hippies, not hipsters) combined with Asheville's lush, woodsy backdrop and the Blue Ridge Mountains that keeps the vibe down to earth rather than insufferably cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the hotels in Asheville offer a great value by American standards, many of them seem determined to aesthetically replicate one of Asheville's biggest tourist attractions, The Biltmore estate. While there's nothing wrong with Biltmore, to me the Airbnb inventory offers a much more authentic representation of what makes Asheville unique, such as woodsy cottages and mystical domes created by the artists who live there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those concerned about accessibility we recommend staying in a ground floor room at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebeaucatcher.com/&quot;&gt;The Beaucatcher&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bohemianhotelasheville.com/&quot;&gt;Grand Bohemian Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Asheville.

&lt;p&gt;This historic 116-year old cottage is so picturesque, and makes us feel like we're in Central Europe instead of the U.S. The home itself is located a bit farther out from Asheville in a rural area, but it is close to major roads leading downtown and into the mountains. Many reviewers also mentioned waking up to the sight of bunnies and puppies outside their window so... if you're not sold on that, do you even have a heart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one's for the adventure seekers. The geodesic dome is located farther out in the woods— so it's not the best spot if you're wanting to dine out often. But it does offer gorgeous views of the surrounding nature. For the price and size this would be a totally great option for solo-travelers too, but I think it would be so romantic to experience this place with company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like 90% of the yurts I see on Airbnbs are overpriced for what they offer. Sorry, it's true. Serenity Yurt however makes the cut because it has almost as many amenities as a hotel or typical airbnb— including a functional bathroom, kitchen area with fridge, and a huge wraparound porch with a hot tub.

&lt;p&gt;This is what I love about Asheville: that in the American southeast you can somehow find what looks to be Sherlock Holmes' modern day bachelor pad. This home is actually gorgeous, though. It's got two cozy living rooms, a spacious and modern kitchen, even a little home gym with a sunroof. It's the perfect place for a fall or winter group gathering. Accomodates up to 5 people.&lt;/p&gt;

They weren't kidding about the 'best view' part as every room in the single story home has huge windows. It's spacious, it's luxurious, surrounded by nature, and it even has underfloor heating. I mean, come on. Accomodates up to 4 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve heard that Tromsø is beautiful in the summer, it mainly draws visitors in the colder months because it is one of the best places in the world to view the Aurora Borealis, or northern lights. That’s certainly what brought me to this arctic destination— so I didn’t expect to fall in love with the city for a whole bunch of other reasons. Of all the cities I visited in Norway, Tromsø was my favorite. The locals were so incredibly friendly, the food was amazing, and it had such a laid-back, cozy atmosphere. If I could describe it in a few words I might call it a metropolitan fishing village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We certainly have lots to say about chasing the northern lights, but first let’s talk about where to stay when you head up north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f2 mt5 mb0&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Where to Stay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc f6 light-silver i mb4&quot;&gt;Rates are based on a one-night search for February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tromsø’s hospitality scene seems nascent compared to larger Norwegian cities like Oslo and Bergen. The Airbnb inventory left something to be desired and there are few if any independently run hotels— especially if you want to be located near the city center. In fact, this is one of the few times our top recommendations include hotels that are a part of a larger chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For solo travelers &amp;amp; the budget conscious — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/no/comfort-xpress-tromso.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Comfort Hotel Xpress Tromsø&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $136/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/tromso/comforthotel_1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/tromso/comforthotel_2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort Hotel Xpress is part of Scandinavian chain Nordic Choice Hotels, which is a franchise of American-owned Choice Hotels, which operates Comfort Inn &amp;amp; Suites in the US. But this isn’t your momma’s Comfort  hotel. After spending days of research trying to find a place to stay I ultimately decided to stay at Comfort Hotel because of its location, positive reviews, and the price— since Tromso was the last leg of my trip and Norway is expensive, I really wanted to cut costs here. Honestly, I went into this with low expectations but found myself pleasantly surprised by this Comfort Hotel outpost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they offer room rates specifically for single travelers. Which is great because as a solo-traveller I hate paying more for space I won’t use. The hotel is centrally located in the town center and walking distance to every single attraction. Besides my trip from the airport I didn’t take a single taxi here which also helped with my budget. Lastly, as a little cherry on top the hotel lobby has a well-stocked deli stand with grab-and-go items and drinks like coffee and wine available for purchase, which was super convenient when I didn’t feel like going outside in the cold. Check-in and check-out is also done via a tablet in the lobby for minimal human interaction, if that’s a thing you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be lying if I said I didn’t pay attention the interior design of the places I stay at. I do, and sometimes I find that the aesthetics of these modern boutique hotel chains &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be a bit tacky— a little IKEA but with all the leftover green and orange furniture no one wanted. Comfort Hotel Express was actually a step-up from that, although certainly youthful in appearance. It’s like how I imagine Hollywood would interpret what a college dormitory should look like, if that makes sense. The only downside to my stay here was the sad little view from my room of a back alley (look to the more expensive waterfront hotels for a better view) and because it was so youthful there were a couple of loud groups of students staying on my floor. Which wasn’t a huge deal for me because I’m a deep sleeper, but something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Comfort Hotel Xpress has an elevator for wheelchair access to rooms on the upper floors, as well as ground floor units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For bibliophiles &amp;amp; friends traveling together — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bedandbooks.no/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Tromsø Bed &amp;amp; Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $95/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/tromso/bedbooks_2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So admittedly this was my first choice for where to stay in Tromsø, but the small guest house sells out fast so it’s better to book this place way in advance. It’s one of the few individually owned lodging options in the city and while single rooms start at $95, the best deal is the triple room that if fully occupied comes out to a little over $50/night. Bed &amp;amp; Books is run similar to a hostel with shared bathrooms and common areas, including, you guessed it, a generous library for your perusal. My only initial hesitation to staying here was that as a solo-traveler it seemed a little farther out from the city center and I was worried about walking back at night, but having now been to Tromsø and I think the distance is actually not that far at all, and I felt fairly safe walking around at night. I would definitely try to stay here the next time I’m in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Bed &amp;amp; Books doesn't specifically state that they are wheelchair accessible. Considering what we know of the architecture and the presence of stairs, we wouldn't recommend this spot for wheelchair users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For couples &amp;amp; business travelers — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/no/the-edge.en-gb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Clarion Hotel The Edge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $216/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/tromso/clarion_2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarion is another brand operated by Choice Hotels, the same parent company responsible for Comfort Hotel Express. While our other suggestions are perfectly reasonable for couples, if what you’re after is romance than The Edge is a much better choice because of its location on the harbor and majestic views of the water, Arctic cathedral, and surrounding mountains. It’s the most centrally located of the options presented here and also a great choice if someone else is footing your hotel bill. The hotel’s restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitchenandtable.se/story/&quot;&gt;Kitchen &amp;amp; Table&lt;/a&gt;, is run by Marcus Samuelsson and features dishes that combine his Scandinavian background with New York influences. Breakfast at the hotel is also included in most rates, and The Edge also offers lower rates for single travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;The Edge has facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f3 pt5 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;On Airbnbs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are certainly plenty of Airbnbs available, I felt like it was hard to find one that met all of my criteria without trade-offs. For one, I prefer to rent out an entire apartment for privacy and safety. Second, I only want to stay in an Airbnb where the value is better than staying in a hotel. That means I want something that is clean, well-decorated, in a good location, for &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than I would pay for a hotel. Third, reviews matter a lot to me, again for safety reasons. So I personally found it difficult to reconcile all of these things in Tromsø. The options with more affordable rates were often private rooms and not as centrally located. Renting an entire apartment was often more expensive than the hotel rates and the few well-priced options had less than ten reviews. I think it’ll be really interesting to watch the hospitality scene in Tromsø ramp up over the next year or so— the influx of new properties on Airbnb is certainly a sign that it’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f2 mt5 mb4&quot; id=&quot;whattodo&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;What To Do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/tromso/lights_2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what you come to Tromsø for. There's a whole industry around northern light tours and it's fascinating to me because despite being independent competitors all the tour guides essentially work together and constantly communicate with each other throughout the night so that if one person finds the lights, everyone else does too. You'll notice that the tours are often describe as northern light &quot;chases&quot; and that's because there's no guarantee you'll actually see one. But if you pay for a tour these guys will do everything possible to make sure you do. It was raining the night I went on my tour and our guide drove us three hours across the border into Finland to find us a clear patch of sky. The place we ended up, Kilpisjärvi, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afar.com/magazine/get-intimate-with-the-aurora-borealis-in-the-finnish-wilderness?inspiration=outdoor-adventure&amp;amp;sub_inspiration=winter-sports&amp;amp;email=sabrinaymajeed%40gmail.com&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=northern%20lights&amp;amp;utm_term=Daily%20Wander%20Newsletter&quot;&gt;recently featured in a recent article by Away&lt;/a&gt; as the best place to view the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tours can be a little pricey (around $150 per person) and many of my friends have opted instead to rent a car and find the lights on their own. However, since I was traveling alone I felt more comfortable going on a tour and looking back on it I think the price was justified for the total experience. Most of the tours limit themselves to about 12 people, the amount that can fit into a small van. It's a really intimate experience and actually great for meeting other travelers because, at least in my case, it was a nine hour long experience. Three hours driving to find the lights, three hours camping out for them, and three hours driving back to Tromsø. The vans are equipped with high speed wifi for the long drive and the guides were incredibly knowledgable and prepared— ours brought snow suites for everyone as well as hot tea and coffee, and set up a campfire and cooked everyone reindeer hotdogs. Most of the guides are also professional photographers who can help you adjust your camera to the proper settings to capture the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the gas, food provided, and expertise of the guide and the cost of living in Norway, I felt like the cost of the tour was worth it in the end for me. The specific tour I went on was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190475-d6583184-Reviews-Enjoy_the_Arctic-Tromso_Troms_Northern_Norway.html&quot;&gt;Enjoy the Artic&lt;/a&gt; with Andrei, who was amazing, but from what I understand the experience is consistent across the main tours you can find on TripAdvisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite places I ate in all of Norway. Bardus is a cozy little gastropub with the friendliest staff (the waitress gave me tons of suggestions on things to do in Tromsø). But more importantly I had this creamy reindeer ragout with lingonberries and it was so, so good (sorry, Rudolph). They also serve beer from a local brewery in town, in small glasses which was the perfect portion size for me and also a really great way to avoid getting hammered over lunch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tromsdalen Church, a.k.a Ishavskatedralen a.k.a the Arctic Cathedral is the northernmost cathedral in the world. It's a wonderful example of Scandinavian architecture and was designed by architect Jan Inge Hovig in the 60's, with glass mosaics by Norwegian artist Victor Sparre added to the building in the 70's. The unique structure provides for excellent acoustics so many concerts are held at the cathedral. The cathedral is located across a winding bridge from Tromsø's city center. It's about a twenty minute walk across the bridge from start to finish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/tromso/polaria.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polaria is the world's northernmost aquarium and a great option for families with young children (although this adult still had fun by herself). The museum itself is rather small (I probably spent a little less than an hour there) but provides an interactive and educational overview of the area's marine ecology. The main attraction is an open pool with bearded seals, with a live feeding show twice a day. The architecture is also a part of the appeal and is an abstract representation of ice floes pushing up against land. Entrance fees are around $15 for adults and $8 for kids, although they do occasionally have discounted prices (the day I went entrance was 50% off).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathallen may be more familiar to those who've visited the famous food hall in Oslo. This outpost is much smaller and includes a fine dining restaurant and a speciality deli that also makes for a great place to pick up gifts to take home like reindeer jerky. As for the restaurant, they offer a 4-course tasting menu for approx. $86 per person. Ingredients sold in the deli and used in the restaurant are all locally sourced across Norway.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 mb1 lh-title mt0-ns mt3&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Visit Svalbard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBH I'm kind of kicking myself for not spending more time in Tromso, because if I could re-do my trip I would spend less time in Olso and Bergen in order to fit in a trip to Svalbard, an archipelago located a little under two hours north from Tromso by plane. Svalbard is home to the northernmost settlement with a  permanent population (meaning, not researchers). In fact, people often say there are more polar bears in Svalbard than people. In addition to polar bears there are arctic foxes, reindeer, blue whales, narwhals, and a host of other marine species. Fun fact: after Norwegians, Thais are the most populous immigrant group in Svalbard.

&lt;p&gt;So the thing about Bed-Stuy is, there really aren’t many hotels in the neighborhood. Which makes sense because it’s largely a residential neighborhood and not a huge business or tourist center. The dearth of hotels presents a huge opportunity to live like a local in one of the many brownstone apartments available on Airbnb. When compared to the cost of hotels in Brooklyn, this option also tends to be a lot more affordable. In fact, we originally set out to make a list of “the best” places to stay in Bed-Stuy and fortuitously all the places we chose just happened to fall under $100/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guests can stay in one of two available bedrooms in this light-filled apartment, which is shared with the host, Carolina, and her partner. Many reviewers remarked on how clean the apartment was, and positively commented on the amount of privacy afforded for a shared space. If you’re a solo traveller that prefers other humans around, or one who just doesn’t want to pay extra for space you won’t use, Carolina’s apartment is perfect for you and just three blocks from the nearest G train station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For solo-travellers who prefer having the privacy of an entire unit to themselves, look no further than Yoki’s renovated 1800’s brownstone. The apartment is full of historic touches like carved wood and stained glass. The unit is quite cozy, so while it can fit up to 3 guests, for the price we think it’s reasonable to go solo on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This historic brownstone straddles the border between Bed-Stuy and its neighboring neighborhood (heh) Clinton Hill. Donovan’s apartment is not only filled with antiques and unique treasures, it’s a treasure in itself because of the shared backyard space you have access to. Any New Yorker will tell you, that’s quite the rarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For couples looking for a more modern space than the traditional brownstone, there’s Linda and Dorian’s townhouse. The guest unit is located on the basement floor but couldn’t look more inviting. And they weren’t kidding about the ‘spacious’ part. The unit has high ceilings and enough room for a bed, working area, and lounging area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly this is my favorite Airbnb on the list. Michelle’s cozy brownstone studio gets gorgeous light and looks so inviting. It’s actually just fine for a couple or a solo traveller but because of the price (most expensive on this list) we think it’s the best value for a family traveling with young children. Though the studio can sleep 4, other reviewers have noted it can be a little tight for four adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A family of four or group of friends would feel totally comfortable in Pamela’s space. There are two other rooms in the apartment available for rent, making it a true guest-house. The kitchen is spacious for New York standards and many reviewers noted how clean and modern the bathroom facilities are. The other thing they noted? That Pamela is a natural born host.&lt;/p&gt;

I hesitate to even say these are “the best” places to eat at in Bed-Stuy, it’s more like these are the places which I often frequented during my time living in the neighborhood (so don’t be surprised if you notice a disproportionate amount of Asian restaurants featured here). Bed-Stuy is also a very big neighborhood and many of these eateries are located on the west side, closer to where I’m based and near the Bedford-Nostrand G stop as well as the Franklin Avenue C stop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m also not going to talk too much about already very popular Bed-Stuy establishments like Speedy Romeo’s, Peaches Hothouse, and Dough. These spots are all wonderful and have been featured extensively on several lists about the neighborhood’s dining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually found this place because I was looking at nearby cafes with free wifi and their name popped up on the list. I assumed 750 Myrtle Diner was a diner in the traditional American sense but it turned out to be a lovely Japanese diner that’s only open for dinners. Their menu changes daily although fan favorites like the Pon-Kara (their take on karaage) seem to be frequently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moloko is run by the team behind Dynaco, a more popular bar further south in Bed-Stuy. But unlike Dynaco, Moloko offers both drinks and food. It’s a true neighborhood bar and a great place to go for a low-key dinner with friends. They have great happy hour specials and a simple, mostly stable menu, the highlights of which are their burger and the seared tuna sandwich. It is, however, cash only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is literally on my block and according to Foursquare I’ve been there twelve times… which is, probably the most times I’ve ever been to any restaurant in New York. Eva Jean’s is basically my go-to for any occasion: date night, special occassions, catching up with friends, brunch, happy hour (which they dub ‘magic hour’), coffee… It’s the kind of like the room of requirement. The cuisine is New American which kind of means anything goes, and my some of my favorite dishes have been their pastrami eggs benedict and white bean soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swell Dive serves filipino tacos and tiki-style drinks. It’s the newest venture from the owners of another Bed-Stuy establishment, Brooklyn Kolache Co. If you’re from Texas you may be putting two and two together right about now… tacos… and kolaches? Yep, they’re from Austin. And every weekend Swell Dive serves breakfast tacos until 3 p.m. They offer both classic Tex-Mex style breakfast tacos as well as Filipino breakfast tacos— I usually order one of each. When visiting in warmer weather, don’t forget to also check out their backyard patio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually just went here last week on my neighborhood bucket-list tour and fell in love. Not only were the staff exceptionally kind and attentive, it’s hard to decide what to order from the experimental and mediterranean-inspired menu because everything looks so good. I settled on the eggplant menemen— a delicious mix of tomato sauce, eggs, saffron yogurt, and vegetables served with toast— and was not disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilar was actually the first restaurant I ever ate at in Bed-Stuy, long before I lived here. It’s got one of the most beautiful bars in the neighborhood, generous portions (the cuban sandwich is huge), and the best dessert— guava cheesecake. Almost all the entrees are under $20 with the exception of a seafood paella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affordable, southern-inspired brunch. Need I say more? I mean, technically it’s a bar so you can drink here too but honestly I’ve mostly come here when I’m nursing a hangover and desperately need fried, carb-loaded food in my stomach stat. Pretty much everything on their brunch menu is good but the best value is the chicken biscuit sandwich for around $7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil Service is sort of my go-to weekday cafe to work from. It’s usually not too crowded (emphasis on “weekday” because the weekends are a different story), they make a great chai latte, and a mean breakfast sandwich with avocado and hot sauce. The team behind Civil Service also recently opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TheTradeUnionCafe/&quot;&gt;Trade Union cafe&lt;/a&gt; on Malcolm X Blvd further east in Bed-Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nostrand Cafe is an unpretentious and spacious coffeeshop that also serves really good, and simple Korean food. They also offer standard American breakfast and brunch fare with the option to add Bulgogi for an extra fee. Disclaimer: I’m not Korean but I think their bibimbap is pretty solid and the portions are generous. They also serve Korean-fusion items like bulgogi tacos and burritos, and the staff are always super friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samurai Papa isn’t my favorite ramen place in New York City by any means, but it is the closest ramen spot to my apartment and it’s more than decent. They have great lunch specials, really affordable appetizers (we’re talking in the $6 and under range), and a simple ramen menu. I’ve tried both their curry ramen— yum— and their bukkake vegan tomato ramen which was less good, but I’m glad there’s an option for the vegans in the neighborhood. Samurai Papa used to be a lot emptier when it was standing-room only, but now that they’ve added seating you can expect it to be a little more crowded at dinner time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sabrina Majeed</name></author><summary type="html">This is the InnBox’s first list that’s exclusively about food and boy, is it personal.

&lt;p&gt;Last week we covered how Austin is the king city of Airbnbs in terms of quantity and quality. Well, you could say the same for Paris with its endless supply of top notch boutique hotels. There are an almost overwhelming amount of options, all with their own character and many at a surprisingly affordable price for a city with such an expensive reputation. We’ve narrowed down our top picks to help you find the perfect Parisian place for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the recent proliferation of out-of-the-box hostel chains in Europe, it’s always refreshing to come across independently owned hostels that are done well. Les Pialues is located in the up and coming neighborhood of Belleville, a bit farther from many of Paris’ main tourist attractions. The hostel features a custom designed bunk bed intended to improve and reinvent the standard hostel experience. There’s also a poppin’ bar downstairs for guests and locals alike.

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For families — &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.astotel.com/hotel/monterosa-en/overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Hôtel Monterosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $133/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monterosa is the first hotel we’ve featured on The InnBox that’s belongs to a chain, but to be fair the chain in question, Astotel, only operates in Paris. They run 16 hotels all of which are somewhat similar in their design, highly reviewed, and kind on the budget. I personally stayed at the Monterosa and thought it had a great location, being walking distance to both Pigalle and Saint Georges metro stations. The decor is modern and clean, continental breakfast is provided, and we spent countless nights just hanging out drinking tea in the little lobby cafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Hotel Monterosa has an elevator but does not have facilities specifically for handicapped guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For New Yorkers at heart — &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotelpanache.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Hotel Panache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $143/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/paris/panache2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building that houses Hotel Panache has no right angles— it’s triangular shape gives it something in common with the iconic Flatiron building in New York City, and thus that’s where Panache’s industrial designer drew her inspiration. The Flatiron was finished in 1902, so at Panache you’ll find many examples of art nouveau, the major art movement on the time. While each room is uniquely decorated (including one with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cole-and-son.com/en/collection-fornasetti/wallpaper-77/7024/&quot;&gt;malachite wallpaper&lt;/a&gt; I’d sell my unborn child for), they all feature a custom headboard inspired by Thonet bentwood chairs. New Yorkers who’ve spent a lot of time in the Flatiron neighborhood will feel right at home here. We’ve also heard a rumor that if you are traveling with small children they will bring a miniature teepee to your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Second and third floors are accessible by elevator and there are facilities for wheelchair users. Hotel Panache rates are typically above $300 but you can often find discounted rates for under $250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For design nerds — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coqhotelparis.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;COQ Hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $158/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/paris/coq2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COQ is a reference to both the bird and an acronym for “community of quality”. That quality comes through in the curated furnishings like wooden flooring from Limogues and vintage Kilim rugs from Turkey and Moldova. The hotel, which was designed to invoke the sense of being in a family home, also has a dark and muted, almost masculine vibe— a welcome departure from the more clinical white rooms that have become on-trend as of late. The hotel also has a greenhouse and a small courtyard with a chicken coop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Hotel COQ has facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For minimalists — &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotel-lapin-blanc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Le Lapin Blanc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $166/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/paris/lapinblanc2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning “the white rabbit”, Le Lapin Blanc is an ode to Alice in Wonderland without coming across too twee. The decor is all muted millennial pastels against snowy whites, with interesting details like carpet cut-outs that transition into bathroom tile and geometric tubs. Le Lapin Blanc is located in the Latin Quarter, a stone’s throw away from the Sorbonne as well as the famous bookstore Shakespeare and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Le Lapin Blanc has an elevator but does not have facilities specifically for handicapped guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hotel that’s a little more Hermès than Chanel. Housed in a former textile factory, Hotel Fabric pays tribute to its history through its playful and colorful combinations of patterns and textures, such as the fanciful tile work in the bathrooms. While it’s located in a less touristy area it’s still within walking distance to many of Paris’ major attractions but the real value is in its proximity to the fashionable nightlife and restaurant scene in Oberkampf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Hotel Fabric has an elevator and wheelchair accessible facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For the honeymoond period — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoteldejobo.paris/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;Hotel de JOBO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $272/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/paris/jobo2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel is a homage to the former social and empress of France, Josephine Bonaparte (get it? Jo..Bo?). The decor references Josephine’s tastes, like her fondness for roses or her credit for being the first to sport a leopard print rug. The building, a former convent. features 24 rooms, most of which feature revitalized Directoire-era wallpaper and empire style beds. There’s an undeniable air of romance here, making it perfect for new couples who can’t get enough of each other or time-tested romances looking to rekindle the flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt3&quot;&gt;There are some cities that are worth seeing because of the sights, and others worth visiting because of the food. But the best cities have both and Austin is one of those special places. Everytime I visit Austin I see another side to the city I didn't realize existed, and I'm sure I will continue to learn on subsequent trips. But in the meantime, here's a list of the things I *wish* I knew about the first time I visited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://parks.traviscountytx.gov/find-a-park/hamilton-pool&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hamilton Pool Preserve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pr1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/HamiltonPool.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around a thirty minute drive outside of Austin you’ll find Hamilton Pool: the beautiful result of erosion and a collapsed grotto. The pool is open to the public and swimming is allowed (and encouraged!) exempting any bad weather. I’d recommend going on a weekday because it can get crowded (you may even have to wait in line) on weekends. Keep in mind that while it is a pool, there are no lifeguards on duty so swim at your own risk. The entrance fee is $15 per vehicle with discounts for senior citizens and disabled vets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-pool&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barton Springs Pool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pr1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/Barton2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a car or don’t want to make the trek to Hamilton Pool, Austin also has another natural spring pool right within city limits: Barton Springs. With an average temperature of 68-70 degrees, Barton Springs is ideal for swimming year round. The pool is open daily with lifeguard supervision during popular hours. Admission is $8 for most non-residents but discounted for children and seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;The best of Texas barbecue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pr1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/Barbecue.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with the fact that each southern state has its own twist on barbecue, or a style that makes it unique. For Texas, it’s the fact that we prefer beef over pork: brisket, to be exact. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://franklinbbq.com/&quot;&gt;Franklin’s&lt;/a&gt; is undeniably the most famous game in town, you could be waiting in line up to three hours to get some of the low and slow goodness. We recommend checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.labarbecue.com/&quot;&gt;La Barbecue&lt;/a&gt; instead: the joint was started by the daughter of a Texas barbecue legacy. If you get there before opening hours you’ll likely only (only!) have to wait one hour instead of three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/barbarella/4b52a8e5f964a5204c8527e3&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barbarella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pr1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/Barbarella.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night clubs aren’t really my scene anymore but Barbarella’s is different, ok? Maybe that’s just the New Yorker in me talking because I’m not used to bars or spaces that are so… big. Drinking and dancing at Barbarella’s is more like going to a house party that’s actually fun than being at a pretentious club, and with many different rooms at your disposal it’s easy not to get bored. Plus they seem to know my biggest weakness: nostalgic pop music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A failed condo-development reborn as a public art gallery thanks to Shepard Fairey. There are so many details to uncover and explore throughout the ground’s skeleton walls and levels. Climbing to the top will also give you a wonderful view of the downtown. Check out some free art and get a colorful new profile picture while you’re at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/Rainey.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the collegiate crowd that takes over East 6th street at night isn’t your scene but you still want a chill place to have a drink, check out Rainey Street. It’s an adorable little street of old homes that were converted into bars, live music venues, and also a popular parking spot for many food trucks. The crowd tends to be young professionals. Some of our favorite spots on the street are Javelina, BlackHeart, The Container Bar, and Bungalow. Also be sure to check out the whimsical Indian restaurant: G’raj Mahal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Breakfast Tacos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pr1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/Tacos.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a trip to Austin without eating at least one breakfast taco, aka the best breakfast ever. If you’re not familiar, it’s exactly what you think it is: a taco filled with egg, cheese, and bacon for meat-eaters or potatoes and avocado for vegetarians. Our favorite places in Austin to eat breakfast tacos are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tacodeli.com/&quot;&gt;TacoDeli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://juaninamillion.com/&quot;&gt;Juan in Million&lt;/a&gt;, but you can’t go wrong with any of the unnamed taco trucks parked around town either. If you’re willing to drive 30 minutes out of town, there’s a special little truck called “Grandpa’s Tacos” run by an adorable older couple on the side of the highway near Lake Travis that’s worth a stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.batsinaustin.com/&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Congress Bat Bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March through October, every night just before sundown, over 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats fly out from under the South Congress bridge in a giant swarm that’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Yes, you’re going to look like a clichéd tourist standing on the South Congress bridge waiting for nearly an hour but suck it up because nature is cool and it’s worth seeing at least once in your life. Plus it’s free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could probably make a separate list just dedicated to places to eat in Austin, there are so many. Some of the more memorable places we’ve eaten that I’d highly recommend checking out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/elizabeth-st-caf%C3%A9/4ef4c212b8f77e0f983c04e4&quot;&gt;Elizabeth St. Cafe&lt;/a&gt; for Vietnamese food, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/ramen-tatsuya/501831f5e4b06251be422605&quot;&gt;Ramen Tatsu-ya&lt;/a&gt; for Japanese, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/chilantro/54b495ab498ebacc93b337bf&quot;&gt;Chi’lantro&lt;/a&gt; for Korean/Tex-Mex fusion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/hopdoddy-burger-bar/4cb5e045e262b60c46cb6ae0&quot;&gt;Hopdoddy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/tamale-house-east/4f5cd4e6e4b008b15792ebac&quot;&gt;Tamale House East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/salt--time/50d3997ae4b0200540c19f7c&quot;&gt;Salt &amp;amp; Time&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/odd-duck/5256c1f611d2949f1623a789&quot;&gt;Odd Duck&lt;/a&gt; for a fancy meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We highly recommend renting a car in order to fully experience everything has to offer. If you plan on staying inside the city limits you could very well get by with ride-sharing apps, but if you’re interested in checking out some of the incredible nature outside of the city, rent a car! &lt;a href=&quot;http://theinnbox.co/best-airbnbs-austin-texas/&quot;&gt;Read more about our recommendations on where to stay in Austin here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sabrina Majeed</name></author><summary type="html">There are some cities that are worth seeing because of the sights, and others worth visiting because of the food.

&lt;p&gt;Austin is one of my favorite cities in America, and a place I hope to live one day. I’m lucky to have family there’s that shown me all the wonderful places (and the food! THE FOOD) beyond “Dirty Sixth”, a.k.a the strip of downtown bars that I’d often be relegated to when visiting during South by Southwest. Austin is definitely worth visiting outside of the festival season mayhem, especially so that you can have the time to truly explore and take advantage of the incredible hill country nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’ll be heading back there next February, I thought now was as good of a time as any to start thinking about where to stay on my next trip…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f2 mt5 mb2&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;The 9 Best Airbnbs in Austin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s any city in America where you can’t go wrong on Airbnb— it’s Austin. Ironically, I still managed to somehow ‘go wrong’ here— but more on that later. The quality and inventory of Airbnb homes in Austin is unlike any other place I’ve travelled to, so much so that this list is going to be longer than usual and I decided to dedicate a section exclusively to my top Austin Airbnb picks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many modern new developments on Airbnb that provide for a perfectly comfortable and clean place to stay in Austin, I tend to gravitate towards the places that show off more of the city’s weird personality and history. This often means homemade “tiny” homes (bigger than my NYC apartment), vintage airstream trailers, and mid-century modern architecture. The trade off is that some of these options may not be as wheelchair friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;For couples &amp;amp; close friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f4 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5337141?wl_source=list&amp;amp;wl_id=87001568&amp;amp;role=wishlist_owner&amp;amp;adults=1&amp;amp;children=0&amp;amp;infants=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot;&gt;&quot;East Side Beehive&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f5 light-silver&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Starting at $200/Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/austin/Beehive2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most unique Airbnbs I’ve seen on the entire site. The unusual space is the result of designing around city codes and regulatory constraints and many of the materials used were salvage, like the exterior shingles which came from an old home that was remodeled years ago. Despite being a part of the “tiny house movement” this home feels spacious and bright, and is perfectly located in Austin’s East Side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another home that manages to nail the trade-off between natural light and privacy. I love the layout of the home, which is almost like a small, modern warehouse. It’s located near the popular South Congress ave and close to Austin’s amazing outdoors areas like Barton Springs, Zilker Park, and Lady Bird Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most airstream trailers I’ve seen on Airbnb tend to lean fully into a 60s or 70s aesthetic but this one is refreshingly modern without sacrificing personality. The original interior was actually burned out in a fire in the 60s so as a homage the owners refinished many of the walls with burnt cedar, using a Japanese preservation technique known as Sho Sugi Ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Caveat:&lt;/b&gt; Remember how I said “it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible to go wrong with an Airbnb in Austin”? The Last time I was in Austin I stayed in an airstream trailer (not the one listed above). It was beautiful, had friendly hosts, great reviews, but… while there we had a few days of heavy rain and what tends to happen with those is that bugs (like roaches) want to come indoors, and it’s easier to get inside an airstream trailer compared to a house. I mean, it’s just the way mother nature works and you can’t really get mad at anyone (the hosts or the bugs) for it. But it is something to keep in mind. Check the weather before booking, and if you’re not squeamish around bugs this may not be a big deal at all! Personally, I think I can check off staying in an airstream trailer off my list for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look y’all, I’m a sucker for a well-tiled bathroom and this is one of those. This little studio home is located in the back of a garden/farm in North Loop, and walking distance to several restaurants and bars. While it would be a cozy fit for two, I think it’d be even more perfect for a single adventurous soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quintessential tiny home comes with its own porch and a full kitchen, which is perfect if you want to save money on eating out. It’s located in the trendy but quieter residential neighborhood of Windsor Park. I also love how the design of the building lets in light while still feeling private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the price, I don’t think you can do better on location than this Airbnb, especially for first time visitors. You’re walking distance to all the bars and restaurants on Cesar Chavez (including La Barbecue, if you want to get in line early) and close to the popular nightlife areas: Rainey Street and East 6th Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exterior of this home is so unique and the spacious (by New York standards) kitchen is perfect for people who love to cook. It’s also one of the few homes for big groups I’ve seen that actually has 2.5 baths, meaning less holding your pee and fighting over the shower. They even have an Ofuro soaking tub on the (private) balcony if you’re into that. Accommodates up to 6 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this home looks more like what I would expect to find in L.A., like the set of a crazy party in a Bret Easton Ellis novel. But that’s what makes its presence in Austin weird and therefore… appropriately Austin? Enjoy browsing the home’s art collection and discovering cool oddities like the giant “bird bath” tub or jungle-themed bathroom. Accommodates up to 7 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be called a “hostel” but you won’t find raucous partying or youths here. The group behind Native Hostels set out to design a hostel for adults and it shows in the decidedly grown-up decor. It’s also got a great location, straddling the border between the younger, dirty 6th-area and the quieter but still happening East Cesar Chavez Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying at the Kimber Modern is what I imagine a sleepover in a modern art museum would be like. The hotel was conceived of by a local couple who wanted to channel their traveling experiences into designing the perfect place to stay (truly, ladies after my own heart). The hotel only has five rooms and one of the owner’s main goals was to make each room as quiet as possible: hence investments in a $44,000 Mitsubushi heating system that is virtually noiseless, and “Quiet Rock”, a sound-insulating drywall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver&quot;&gt;Rooms at the Kimber Modern are only accessible by stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally a bungalow built in 1925, the Heywood refurbished itself as a 7-room hotel on Cesar Chavez Street in East Austin (my favorite location, if you couldn’t tell by my other recommendations). All the beds in the hotel sit on walnut wood platforms handmade by one of the owners, along with other artisans crafts and furniture throughout which guests are able to purchase. Your stay also comes with free bicycles for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Austin Motel has been around since 1938, when it earned itself the nickname of “The Phallus Palace” (the shape of the sign should give that one away). The historic motel has recently come under the management of the group behind Austin’s well known Hotel San Jose and Hotel Saint Cecilia. It recently reopened with updated furnishings, including custom wallpaper by https://voutsa.com/ that references the original, retro designs. The attached restaurant is still under renovation but for now you can relax at the poolside bar, explore South Congress, hang out in the courtyard, or even walk a few blocks to its new sister hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you decide to stay in an Airbnb or at a hotel, we highly recommend renting a car in order to fully experience everything has to offer. If you plan on staying inside the city limits you could very well get by with ride-sharing apps, but if you’re interested in checking out some of the incredible nature outside of the city, rent a car! &lt;a href=&quot;http://theinnbox.co/what-to-do-austin-texas&quot;&gt;Read more about what to do in Austin here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sabrina Majeed</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
