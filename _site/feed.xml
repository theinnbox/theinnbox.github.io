&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Providence. The biggest city in America's smallest state. It's a known creative hub; home to one of the country's best art and design schools and a history in textile manufacturing. It's the perfect weekend getaway on the east coast, particularly in the summer season when the surrounding waters warm up and locals and visitors alike embrace the salty seas. Foodies will also appreciate the unending supply of American restaurants, from fine dining spots downtown to the burgeoning brunch scene in the city's more youthful neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The Dean is often described as New England's answer to the Ace Hotel and it's not surprising to see why: The Dean is also home to a hip coffeeshop, bar, and restaurant, making it more than just a hotel but a place for people in Providence to hang out. The rooms are minimally decorated but with classic east coast twists like off-white walls, golden fixtures, and dark industrial furniture; all of which are an ode to the city's manufacturing background. The building's former life as a strip club and brothel also adds hidden meaning to the hotel's cheeky tagline &quot;Sleep with The Dean&quot;. The Dean offers affordable bunk rooms for groups of friends as well as rooms for solo-travelers. We stayed here in a double room for a long weekend in 2015 and loved it's central, downtown location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;The Dean Hotel offers facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Located in a renovated 1880's mill building, Dye House Lofts is home to an adorable couple and their ceramic studio, as well as two tastefully decorated lofts that are available for guests. The warehouse space gets amazing light, features beautiful art and ceramics, and some amazing tile work, like that red shower which is giving me 80's gym vibes, in the best possible way. The property is located in Olneyville, a quiet arts neighborhood that's less central but still only a seven minute drive away from downtown. Dye House Lofts has a three-night minimum stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Guests under 21 years of age are not permitted. Please reach out directly to the hotel for more information on accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I can't get over the dreamy, cobalt blue kitchen cupboards, slanted ceilings, and candy-colored exterior that make this Airbnb seem straight out of a storybook. The host, Chip, operate four separate Airbnbs out of this building but this top floor unit with its half-moon windows and pyramid alcoves is our favorite. The Airbnb is located in a safe, diverse, and thus far un-gentrified neighborhood near both Federal Hill and Downtown— where Chip has lived for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;This Airbnb is a top-floor unit accessible only by stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This bright, modern Airbnb is operated by a jewelry designer who has lived in Providence for the past twelve years. We love how the space is accented with interesting, artful pieces like chunky, knitted throws on the bed or vintage tufted mustard colored chairs in the living room. The bathroom also features a steam-room shower. Even though the Airbnb is big enough for four, at its price point it's also a great deal for a couple or pair of friends. The unit is located in the city's Armory neighborhood, walking distance to several hip cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;This Airbnb is located on the ground floor, however entrance to the building requires going up a small stoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This Airbnb is our pick for families and large groups. The Airbnb can comfortably accommodate 5 (but can squeeze in up to 7) which makes it a steal at its price point. This is also a great example of how furniture and decor can add so much personality into a space with relatively straight-forward architecture. White boxes and a standardized kitchen are brought to life with colorful textiles, clashing patterns, tiny trinkets and large sculptures. The home was originally built in 1855 but renovated last year in 2017 and is operated by a mother and daughter duo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, I'm not a huge museum person but I do love small-sized institutions that are approachable and not overwhelming. The art museum affiliated with the Rhode Island School of Design is just that. It's small but covers a wide breadth from classical to contemporary art, and the buildings that form the museum are just as gorgeous as the works housed within. It's a solid way to spend an afternoon and afterwards take a stroll around the nearby campus and take in all the colorful, adorable houses. Admission to the museum is free on Sundays.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour's drive out of Providence is the port-town of Newport. The town can be best described as a J-crew catalog come to life but that doesn't mean it's without charm. Kick back with a beer and some stuffed quahogs on the pier or check out the International Yacht Restoration School (IYRS) where you can view a yacht currently in the process of restoration and peep all the interesting vintage artifacts they found onboard scattered throughout the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 mb1 lh-title mt0-ns mt3&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Pick fruits at Sweet Berry Farm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all love farmer's markets but those of us who live in urban enclaves rarely get to pick out the goods ourselves. Sweet Berry Farm, located halfway between Providence and Newport, is known for their 'picking season' which runs from June to November. You get charged by the basket and are allowed to roam the fields and harvest your own fruits. Very IRL Stardew Valley! We went during strawberry and raspberry season and had so much fun trying to pick the 'best' fruits. But beware— hands and shirts will get stained so maybe keep your summer whites in the suitcase for this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 mb1 lh-title mt0-ns mt3&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Take a hike at Hanging Rock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a short drive from Sweet Berry Farm is Norman Bird Sanctuary, which is also home to seven miles of hiking trails. Since you'll be driving a lot to get around in Providence, it's definitely worth a pit stop to stretch your legs. The sanctuary's most famous trail is Hanging Rock, which is a ridge trail that leads up to a seventy feet tall overlook, where you'll be rewarded with sweeping views of the Rhode Island coastline. Admission is $7.00. For folks who are really into the outdoors, you can even stay in an adorable &lt;a href=&quot;http://normanbirdsanctuary.org/farmhouse/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Farmhouse&lt;/a&gt; on the sanctuary grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dorrance is the exact opposite of the cozy, teeny tiny little cocktail bars I usually find more romantic. Yet with its tall ceilings, stained glassed windows, and dramatic curtains it still manages to make me feel a little wistful. This downtown cocktail bar and restaurant is located in an old Federal Reserve building and gets pretty lively on the weekend nights. Order a craft cocktail and head upstairs to the balcony level for people watching and privacy— or, if it's not already occupied, you can try nabbing the couch in the building's old vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many new brunch restaurants that have cropped up in recent years in Providence's hip Federal Hill neighborhood, Julian's has been a neighborhood establishment for over twenty years. Their signature also happens to be my favorite brunch dish: Eggs Benedict. Take your pick of seven different varieties and one of their creative hash sides. If Benedicts aren't your thing the restaurant also offer you eggs wrapped, poached in shakshuka, scrambled into a pizza, or fried into an omelet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mt4-ns mt3 mb4-ns mb3&quot; src=&quot;/images/calma/splash.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
A ten minute motorbike ride outside of central Ubud is the residential village Kutuh Kaja, where at night the skies are dotted with more stars than many of us city dwellers are used to seeing, and by day large swaths of rice fields dominate the scenery. Here is where you'll find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?cid=1801609&amp;amp;pcs=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=1258271&quot; targt=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Calma Ubud&lt;/a&gt;, the most accurate picture of a boutique hotel if there ever was one, and one of the best values in Ubud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Calma Ubud consists of ten individual rooms set in what feels like a very private complex of villas. Operating at such a small scale the hotel is able to provide a high quality experience for guests at a lower cost than many of the larger resorts dotting the Ubud area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Checking in at the Ubud was a fairly straight forward process, although finding the hotel for the first time is a little tricker— keep those eagle eyes out because it's very easy to drive by as the hotel blends so seamlessly into the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Calma's lobby is open aired and elegantly decorated, a little taste of what's to come when you enter the compound. We signed up for a spa package during check-in and then were guided through a few wooden doors to our suite, where we were greeted with complimentary mojitos as a welcome drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We had booked a &quot;Superior Room&quot; and honestly I was a little surprised at the size of the bedroom, which was smaller than I had expected. The Calma Ubud has ten rooms but six different room types, and it gets kind of confusing to keep track of the hierarchy here. I think I had mistaken the &quot;Superior Room&quot; for the &quot;Superior Double or Twin&quot; which appears a little more spacious in photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Nonetheless, it wasn't a huge disappointment and because of the large bathroom and easy access to the hotel's common areas, we never felt cramped or like there wasn't enough room for the two of us. Since Ubud is also packed with sights to see and we had a relatively short time there (two days) we weren't spending that much time in our room anyway. Our room also included a little patio in front with two chairs, straw blind for privacy, and buddha statue out front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The room itself was very minimal in decoration. I loved the carved white wooden headboard, jade colored side tables, and vibrant woven rug, but I'm not going to lie I wasn't super into the minimalist wooden wall art on display in the room. Since the room is already so sparse I would've loved to see some color on the walls in addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;As usual, the bathroom is always a highlight for me and the Calma Ubud is no exception. The open shower area has a skylight that fills the room with the most wonderful warm ambiance in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
There was plenty of counter space around the sink for all of our things and the landscape mirror was perfect for two girls to get ready at the same time. The bathroom also has a drying rack in addition to a ladder-style towel rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The center-piece of the Calma is the infinity pool overlooking rice fields in the back. Due to the hotel's small size the pool was never over-crowded during our stay. It's the perfect place to spend the afternoon and chill out with a happy hour drink after seeing sights all day. On the other side of the pool is also a quieter wooden deck area with a few lounge chairs overlooking the fields if you're looking for some privacy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/18.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The pool is connected to the hotel's restaurant, which is tastefully decorated with a variety of seating options: bar, coffee tables with sofas, hammocks, a large communal table, and more traditional cafe-style tables for two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I feel like I had very mixed experiences with the service at Calma Ubud. There were certain staff members who went above and beyond during our stay, like the front desk attendant who went around asking the other staff members for small bills so that I could break a large bill to pay my motorcycle driver. Or the friendly young man who would drive the hotel's van to drop us off in central Ubud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;On the flip side, breakfast our first day was somewhat stressful. Knowing that our tour guide was coming to pick us up at a certain time, I wanted to make sure I was able to get breakfast, which is included free with your stay. I think the restaurant must've been understaffed that day because it took over twenty minutes before someone was able to take my order. We ended up having to ask them to package breakfast to go in order to leave the hotel on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;In addition when we booked our spa services it wasn't clear to us that we had essentially booked a 'couples' treatment when what we wanted were two individual treatments. This meant we shared a lot of the same time and resources but without any discount on the price of the services. Despite this, I would still recommend getting a massage or bath at the spa if that's something that interests you— ultimately the price is so much more affordable than getting similar treatments in the U.S. that it's hard to complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Despite my complaints about the slow service in the kitchen, I have to say the food itself was amazing. The strawberry crepes we had for breakfast the first day were some of the best I've ever had. I think it's super impressive albeit ambitious that their free breakfast is made to order from a decently varied menu, considering most hotels with free breakfast will either set out a buffet or limit their menu to two or three options at most. The free breakfast also includes your choice of juice or a smoothie in addition to tea and/or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you're looking for a quiet and tranquil area to stay in Ubud you can't get much better than the Calma. However, the hotel isn't walking distance to any restaurants or sights. You'll need to take the hotel shuttle to downtown Ubud which is free if you go according to their shuttle schedule or around $6 each way (for the whole party) outside. Our schedule pretty much never worked out with the shuttle so we ended up paying for the shuttle a few times, with the return trip always being a little cheaper because you can just find a driver in Ubud to take you back for less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I'm still kind of torn on whether or not I would've liked to stay in Central Ubud. On the one hand, it's nice to be close to all the restaurants, shops, and nightlife. On the other hand, it's also nice to be in a more relaxing environment with the space to stretch out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While there are ground-floor rooms available at the Calma, there are steps all over the hotel grounds that it's hard for me to recommend this place for wheelchair users. With the exception of the upper-floor suites these tend to be short flights, but they are there separating the rooms from the pathway to the restaurant, from the restaurant to the pool, from the pool to the spa area and the lounge/deck area on the other side of the pool. There are also shallow steps around the various thresholds and doorways leading to the suites from the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/17.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you really want to go &quot;all out&quot; during your stay to Ubud there are definitely bigger, more reputable resorts that are worth checking out. However, if you are keen to stick to a budget but still want to stay somewhere inspiring and relaxing then I think the Calma Ubud is one of the best options in the area. It's price point is simply lower than average for the quality they deliver and as long as you keep that in mind and overlook a few flaws, you'll be happy with your stay.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently in the midst of planning a trip back to New York City so we can visit friends and renew our long-term Thai visas. After staying in so many stunning yet affordable places across Southeast Asia, needless to say the reality of the New York lodging market had me &lt;i&gt;shook&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While I ultimately ended up booking four nights at the airy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-boro-hotel-lic.html?aid=1452227&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Boro Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Long Island City, I probably had about forty Airbnb tabs and Booking.com tabs open simultaneously. If I hadn't stumbled on a discounted rate for Boro, we probably would've ended up staying in an Airbnb because it would've been more affordable for a four-night stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While browsing Airbnb I found myself fascinated by the variety of homes available in New York. Location is responsible for a big variety in both design and price of available units. Inspired by BuzzFeed posts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/heres-what-1000-a-month-in-rent-will-get-you-in-all-50?utm_term=.wagZgQKPR#.yizKOJ1w4&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; which focus on the difference in rent prices across different states, I thought it'd be fun to compare how far $200 a night can get you in New York— that's approximately the average rate for an entire home according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://insideairbnb.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inside Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f3 pt4 pb3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;The Rules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.)&lt;/b&gt; I will only be comparing &quot;entire units&quot;, not private rooms or shared rooms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.)&lt;/b&gt; I'll be comparing Airbnbs in all five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island) as well as New Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3.)&lt;/b&gt; I won't be factoring in cleaning fees since that will vary the nightly rate based length of stay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4.)&lt;/b&gt; I'll be looking for the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; places I can find under $200, rather than showing you the most &lt;i&gt;typical&lt;/i&gt; place. We're talking best case scenario here!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5.)&lt;/b&gt; In order to determine the 'best' I'm factoring in: design, size, location, and amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

This apartment has all the classic East Village vibes — including an alcove studio that's &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; like a bedroom, but not quite. The unit can accomodate up to 2 guests.&lt;/p&gt;

I honestly had to do a double-take when I realized this Airbnb was located in Staten Island. It's one of the better designed spots on this list— artful without feeling forced. It can comfortably accommodate up to 5 guests.&lt;/p&gt;

This unique Airbnb in Williamsburg feels both opulent and refined at the same time. It's got a nautical vibe and labeling it a 1 bedroom, while technically true, is a bit of a stretch. The unit can accommodate up to 2 guests. &lt;/p&gt;

This charming Airbnb is located on the cusp of Greenwich and West Village, with a quintessentially quirky layout. The alcove area for the bed is also quite spacious— the only thing stopping it from being a true bedroom is a door. The unit can accomodate up to 2 guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mt4-ns mt3 mb4-ns mb3&quot; src=&quot;/images/slow/01.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Just five minutes from the beach in the little surfer town of Canggu is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?cid=1801609&amp;amp;pcs=1&amp;amp;hid=1515695&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Slow&lt;/a&gt; —  an art gallery as much as it is a boutique hotel and the brainchild of Australian fashion designer George Gorrow (of Ksubi) and his wife Cisco Tschurtschenthaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The hotel, described by its owners as an exercise in &quot;tropical brutalism&quot;, was designed in collaboration with local architect Rieky Sunur of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gfabarchitects.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;GFAB architects.&lt;/a&gt; Every detail at The Slow has been designed with intentionality, to coax bustling tourists into relaxation, and encourage guests to take full advantage of the beautiful space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The check-in process at The Slow was surprisingly informal and began as soon as our car pulled up into their driveway. One thing I love about staying at smaller hotels is that with only a few people checking in each day, they seem to know exactly who you are when you arrive. Rather than awkwardly waiting at a desk for them to pull up our information, the staff were ready and immediately took us and our bags to our room, which they proceeded to give us a quick tour of, noting little details like how to control the volume on the in-room speakers and all the storage space in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/slow/02.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The room itself was one of the most comfortable and spacious that I've ever stayed in. The polished concrete floors and vertically slatted windows made the room feel surprisingly cool despite the hot Bali weather outside. The room's aesthetic seemed to have a decidedly Californian influence— minimalist, modern, and airy but paired with more traditional wooden furniture and textiles. When we first entered the room the stereo was even set to Cali-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://reverberationradio.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Reverberation Radio&lt;/a&gt;, which we kept on for most of our stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/slow/04.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I loved the low platform bed and found myself curing up with the cozy woven blanket on top of the bed several times during the course of our stay. Another small, appreciated detail was the outlet set-up: an equal amount of outlets on each side of the bed with USB outlets included (perfect for those who forgot to pack an adapter). One other thing I have to compliment The Slow on is their in-room art curation. Normally I find myself unmoved by hotel art. It's usually very predictable, more often than not some kind of floral still life. Even at the nicest hotels! It was refreshing to see something different on the walls at The Slow, which tends to feature more modern art and photography from the Gorrows' personal collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/slow/05.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Slow only has two types of rooms: pool suites and non-pool suits (called grand suites). I initially wanted to book a pool suite but they were unsurprisingly all sold out for my travel dates. Even without a pool the grand suite still felt luxurious— and it's hard to complain when you're just a five minute walk down the street to the nearest beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Bathrooms at The Slow have a narrow layout but still managed to feel spacious like the rooms themselves. I loved the open shower, separated from the rest of the bathroom by a single pane of glass and from prying eyes outside by a full-length frosted window. The shower also comes with a handy bench, the perfect prop for shaving legs or hosting your toiletries, and plenty of hooks for hanging towels or clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fn center mb3 mb4-ns tc&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/slow/08.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The bathroom also kind of serves as a walk-in closet with ample storage space, including tons of drawers or a platform perfect for throwing your suitcase on top of (if you're lazy like me and don't want to fully unpack). There's also a large full-length mirror at the opposite end of the bathroom from the shower which was *very* appreciated, because if there's one thing I always lament when it's missing in a hotel room, it's a full-length mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;While the rooms at The Slow are so spacious that it's tempting to hole up in there during your downtime, the hotel also has some beautifully designed common areas that are worth checking out. The upper level, where our room was located, has an outdoor deck. My only complaint was that it was way too hot during the day to really hang out there (and despite it being a fully booked hotel, no one was). Adding in some kind of shade or deck cover would definitely make this area more inviting for guests!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/slow/13.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Downstairs at the bar and restaurant, things are a little more active. We spent a lot of our downtime just chilling at the bar with a glass of rosé, chatting idly with the staff and occasionally with other guests when seated on the two sofas in the lobby. The ground floor of the hotel also acts as an art gallery with a rotating collection of artwork on display there. While we were there they were displaying work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brooklynwhelan.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Brooklyn Whelan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.josemiguelmendez.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Jose Mendez.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The service was one of the highlights of staying at the Slow for me. The staff were all so personable, it's kind of amazing how well they get to know you even over the course of a two night stay. The bartender was constantly giving us recommendations on where to go and when the staff would ask about our day plans they always had some good advice or interesting facts to impart about the places we were going. They were also helpful with getting us a car to take us to Tanah Lot, going as far as to call around to make sure that we got a good rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Breakfast at The Slow may have been my favorite of the whole trip to Bali. While it wasn't included in our stay, it felt reasonably affordable for the quality. If I'm being honest, a lot of my meals at trendier restaurants in Bali tended to look a lot better than they tasted, but the food at The Slow's restaurant actually tasted incredible. I ordered this jackfruit-bread with roasted bananas for breakfast and while I've had jackfruit many times before, I've never had anything quite like this. The bread was perfectly moist, with just the right amount of sweetness and jackfruit chunks baked in. They've also got a nice selection of juices and cocktails which are bottled on site. In retrospect I kind of wish we ate more of our meals at the restaurant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Slow is located in a neighborhood on Bali's southwest coast called Canggu (pronounced &lt;i&gt;Chang&lt;/i&gt;-gu), which has a reputation for being a laid-back surfer town. It was probably my favorite area that we visited in Bali— a nice reprieve from the more tourist-crowded Ubud and Kuta. That's not to say there aren't tourists in Canggu, but it seems that most people staying in Canggu are there to simply experience hanging out in the area rather than to visit any specific attraction. There were more intriguing restaurants than we had time to visit and a surprising amount of cute clothing boutiques popping up on the main drag. The Slow itself was also located just a few minutes away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/the-lawn/56640fb1498e318179a472e4&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Lawn&lt;/a&gt;, a dreamy outdoor bar on the beach and also next door to a gorgeous yoga studio, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thepracticebali.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Practice&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing which gives me a little pause about Canggu is how the town will continue to balance its growing western influence. Depending on where you go in Canggu, one might wonder if they're actually in Australia rather than Indonesia. Granted, this is an issue affecting many places in Bali, not just Canggu, but the western influence is more vivid here than even in Ubud. While it's not so bad now, I wonder how this balance will change as Canggu's popularity continues to grow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While The Slow doesn't outright claim to be accessible, there are ground floor units available (the more expensive pool suites). The upper units are unfortunately only accessible by stairs. If planning to stay in Canggu, wheelchair users should be aware that the sidewalks in the area around The Slow can often be blocked with construction debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/slow/15.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I would totally recommend The Slow to any art and design lovers planning a trip to Bali. The small size of the hotel will grant you plenty of attention from the staff, and the overall quality of the hotel is a great deal at its price point compared to most American hotels. This is not a drop-your-stuff-off and come back to sleep type of hotel, this is a place you'll actually want to spend your time at, to literally &quot;slow down&quot;, if you will. &lt;/p&gt;

Hội An is a charming little seaside town and preserved historic district located about an hour south of the port city of Da Nang. Its streets are lined with bright orange buildings and traffic flows across green colored canals that divide up the town. It's a popular destination for couples due to its relaxed and romantic atmosphere but it's also a great option for families with kid-friendly activities like cooking classes and sunny beaches. It's a foodie heaven thanks to daily night markets and regional twists on popular Vietnamese dishes. Hội An is the perfect place to pause for a few days and watch the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Nhi Nhi hotel is proof that more traditional aesthetics can still be a breath of fresh air. It's a counterpoint to the many sparsely decorated hotel rooms Hội An. The Nhi Nhi's gorgeous sun-lit interior courtyard will transport you back in time— and don't many of us travel to be transported? All the little details in the rooms, from the pattern of the bathroom tile to the wood-carved furniture, may fill you with a wistful sense of nostalgia, if you're of East or Southeast Asian descent like me. The staff was exceptionally friendly and kind, and their breakfast buffet was one of the best we had in Hội An. The hotel is located on the west side of town, in a quiet area but about a five minute walk away from Old Town. Nhi Nhi is a little more affordable than most hotels in Hội An, and perfect for anyone trying to balance a budget— but I do think it's worth it to splurge a little to make sure your room has an interior facing balcony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;The Nhi Nhi hotel has ground floor rooms available with accessible bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Atlas is a 48-room hotel most known for its stunning exteriors which utilize over 100 cantilevered concrete planters to give the illusion of being surrounded by a lush jungle, whether you're inside your room or chilling in one of the hotel's many courtyards. The hotel was actually shortlisted for the World Architecture Festival awards in 2017 and was designed by the Vietnamese architect Vo Trong Nghia and his firm, who are known for their deft use of greenery in urban spaces (see the stunning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/2017/04/13/vo-trong-nghia-binh-house-planted-terraces-interspersed-living-spaces-architecture-residential-vietnam/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Binh House&lt;/a&gt; in Saigon). The hotel is also just a few blocks away from the famous Japanese Bridge that marks the entrance into Old Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Atlas Hội An has an elevator for accessing upper floors and allergy-free rooms available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The Azumi is a minimalist, 14 room boutique hotel on the eastern side of Hội An. Their furnishings are higher quality than many similarly priced hotels in the area, and I can say as a soft-bed lover that their bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in during the past year— I melted right in. Their beds are also curiously positioned in the center of the room, surrounded by lounging chairs in the front and a desk in the back. Their bathrooms also feature steam room showers (your girl's fave). Azumi is located about a ten minute's walk away from all the action in Old Town, which is ideal for guests who prefer a quieter atmosphere. If you're worried about the distance though, Azumi has some cute bikes that are free for guest use and will get you to Old Town in a snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Upper floors are accessible by stairs only, however Azumi has ground floor villas in which the entire unit is wheelchair accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The eponymous Trinh Diem Vy is a culinary institution in Hội An.  She's an accomplished cookbook author and the proprietor of several of Hội An's most famous restaurants: Morning Glory, Mermaid, Vy's Market Restaurant, and Vy's Kitchen &amp;amp; Deli. Maison Vy marks her first foray as a hotelier. The hotel is tastefully decorated in a swath of off-white and turquoise and floor-to-ceiling windows. It's located a little farther out from Hội An's old town (about a ten minute walk, similar to Azumi) so again a great choice for any light sleepers. Breakfast is included with most rates, and given her extensive culinary success, you know it's going to be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Upper floors are accessible by stairs only, however Maison Vy does have ground floor facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f2 mt4 mb4&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;What to do in Hội An&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Take a stroll through Old Town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hoian/oldtown.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Hội An Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the main attraction which draws visitors to the sleepy seaside town. Within it's streets you'll find signature yellow buildings and clay roof titles under which lie hidden coffeeshops, clothing stores, and restaurants. There are a few historic sites and temples in Old Town that you'll need to buy tickets to see up close, although we ended up just walking around and instead visiting some of the temples located just outside of Old Town for free. The best time to visit Old Town is at night when all of the lanterns are lit up (although black outs do happen occasionally). I highly recommend taking a boat ride down the canal at night for a little bit of romance— you'll be surrounded by paper lanterns and even get to deposit one of your own into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Eat Bánh Mì @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/madam-kh%C3%A1nh--the-b%C3%A1nh-m%C3%AC-queen/51b67b8b498e9270692a1655&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Madam Khánh's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hoian/bahnmi.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;My favorite bánh mì I've had out of all my trips in Vietnam was at a little shop here called &quot;Madam Knanh - The Bánh Mì Queen&quot;. Some say it's the best banh mi in all of Vietnam— I don't think I'm enough of an expert to support or deny that claim but it sealed the deal for me. You can order from a very limited menu of bánh mì (always a good sign) and a much more vast menu of drinks. One bánh mì will set you back 20,000 dong which is less than $1.  The eponymous Madam Knanh (which is technically not her real name, it's her husband's last name which she never formally took) didn't seem to be making sandwiches anymore, at least when I visited, but she was patrolling the restaurant with a huge wad of cash in her hands, monitoring her employee's performance and collecting them bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor2&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Visit Mỹ Sơn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hoian/myson.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Mỹ Sơn is technically not in Hội An but rather about an hour's drive into the countryside. Still, it's one of the top things to do in the area and worth the day trip. Mỹ Sơn is a holy site composed of the ruins of Hindu temples, with a storied history. It was only 'discovered' in our recent history by French colonialists in the 1800s, who then took parts of the ruins back with them to France, where they now sit in the Louvre, which refuses to return the artifacts to Vietnam. Then during the war in Vietnam, U.S. forces bombed the area, inadvertently destroying the majority of the temples. Visiting the site is not only a visual experience, but a contemplative one. The entrance fee to Mỹ Sơn is roughly $6 per person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Take a Cooking Class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;You'll see signs advertising cooking classes all over Hội An. We chose to do ours through &lt;a href=&quot;https://tastevietnam.asia/cooking-classes&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Vy's Market Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; (the same Miss Vy of Maison Vy mentioned above). It was a little pricier due to Miss Vy's reputation but very informative. The class included a tour of the local market in Hội An, and a tasting of some examples of local street food, which included some delicacies I personally hadn't tried before, like duck egg embryo and silk worm salad (okay I chickened out of trying the latter). We signed up for the &quot;Holiday Masterclass&quot; which is the school's most popular option but in retrospect perhaps not challenging enough for a couple who cooks frequently at home. There were many young kids in our class which leads me to believe that the &quot;Holiday Masterclass&quot; is a great option for families. My favorite part of the class was learning how to make bánh xèo, a savory pancake made out of rice flour and turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Get Custom Tailored Clothes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hoian/tailor_1.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hoian/tailor_2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Hitting up the tailor shops is a *thing* in Hội An, where silk shops line the streets, and it's a great idea if you struggle to find clothes that fit you off the rack. Being a petite lady it's pretty much impossible for me to find a jumpsuit that fits so I decided to try to get one made here. Many of the tailor shops are located within a few block's radius of one another and I started my inquiries at one of the highest rated shops in town, A Dong Silk. Their prices were steeper than I had expected at $120 (they did offer to discount if I ordered additional garments). I knew that the other popular shop in town, Kimmy Tailor, would be just as expensive so I skipped that one and wandered over to a Be Be shop (most of the brands have multiple locations within the same block) who was willing to price the jumpsuit at $90, but I wasn't able to find a fabric I liked there. My third time was a charm as I then went to the highly rated but less popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298082-d2717876-Reviews-Peace_Tailor_in_Hoi_An-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Peace Tailor&lt;/a&gt; who offered to do the jumpsuit for $50. Over the course of one and a half days I came in for two fittings as they altered the garment to my perfection. Looking back at the respective shop's TripAdvisor photos, it didn't surprise me that Peace Tailor has more photos of younger customers with progressive styles and pieces than Kimmy &amp;amp; A Dong. So if you're looking for something a little edgier I'd definitely trust them to do justice to your vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Try out the street food @ Hội An's night market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The night market in Hội An is open every night starting at 6pm and a great place to try the local street food. Our favorite was a Vietnamese-style crepe pizza that cost less than $1 (we'd order one and then find ourselves craving another not too long after). My other favorite snack we got was a coconut crepe/cake drizzled with chocolate. There were also sit down restaurants on the side of the street where we had other Hội An and Vietnamese staples like Cao Lầu and Com Ga. I didn't do too much actual shopping at the night market but wandering around at a night surrounded by all the colorful lanterns was magical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Hit up the Beach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hoian/beach.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Okay so I didn't actually go to the beach during my time in Hội An but that's because we already had beach trips to the Philippines and southern Thailand planned. If you're not planning on going to a more well known beach destination, then definitely take advantage of being in Hội An and treat yourself to a beach day! If you're including Hội An in a larger trip with beach destinations than it may be worth putting the time there towards one of the other activities listed here or just having a chill day in Old Town or nearby Da Nang and Hue. An Bang is the most popular beach in Hội An— it used to be Cửa Đại but the latter was damaged by erosion (although parts of it have since recovered and are accessible to visitors). If you're feeling a little more adventurous hitch a couple of hours' boat ride to the nearby Cham Island for a more picturesque beach trip.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sabrina Majeed</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hotel Review: The Marina Bay Sands in Singapore</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/marina-bay-sands-singapore-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hotel Review: The Marina Bay Sands in Singapore" /><published>2018-03-04T11:10:36+07:00</published><updated>2018-03-04T11:10:36+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/marina-bay-sands-singapore-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/marina-bay-sands-singapore-review/">&lt;div style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
It was 2017's most instagrammed hotel in the world and has dozens of other accolades thanks to its iconic rooftop pool, which is the largest elevated swimming pool in the world. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/sg/marina-bay-sands.html?aid=1452227&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Marina Bay Sands&lt;/a&gt; is an architectural marvel at the top of many traveler's bucket list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While the Marina Bay Sands is a departure from the hotels we usually stay at and feature on The Innbox, both in budget and in size, I thought it be worth a one night stay... you know, for &quot;research purposes&quot;. I was curious as to how a hotel like this compared to the smaller, boutique gems I usually gravitate towards. And I admit, I really wanted to check out that pool, which is restricted for hotel guests only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We'd be experiencing the dualities of the city-state: staying in one of the most expensive hotels while eating all of our meals in the affordable hawker centers Singapore has to offer. (Should we do a hawker center guide in the future? Let us know!) Read on to find out if it was worth it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
When we first arrived at the Marina Bay Sands our spirits sank upon sight of the lengthy queue for checking-in. I don't usually stay at hotels big enough to require a &lt;i&gt;velvet rope line&lt;/i&gt; for check-in, and after shelling out the big bucks for this stay I was feeling a bit dismayed. However, as we approached the line one of the hotel staff looked at the booking confirmation on my phone and then quickly escorted us to &quot;VIP Registration&quot;. &lt;i&gt;Huh.&lt;/i&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Turns out that because we had booked a &quot;Premier&quot; room— the cheapest option available when I booked and around $50 more than the cheapest option overall (Marina Bay Sands rooms typically start at $350), that qualified us for VIP treatment. Which basically just meant going into a smaller, exclusive looking room to check-in and avoiding the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
With check-in having gone smoother than expected, we headed to the room... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
So my one reservation when it came to booking the Marina Bay Sands was that in their promotional photos, their rooms look... &lt;a href=&quot;https://r-ak.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1024x768/275/27594339.jpg&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;pretty basic&lt;/a&gt;. It kind of looked like your standard business hotel, devoid of personality, and with... pale yellow walls (seriously, why was this ever a thing?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
So it was a sense of relief I felt when I saw a hazy figure of myself reflected back in the silvery fabric panel behind the bed, cool grey walls, and blonde wood paneling. Maybe they'd updated their rooms since the original photos were taken. Whatever they did, I was just grateful I didn't just spend $400 to stay in like, a room at the Marriott in the 80's. The overall look was actually a bit understated and refined. Was it super unique or trendy? No, but I don't think it's trying to be. She may not be the most charismatic hotel on the block, but Marina is a classy lady who knows who she is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Our room was designated a &quot;Garden View&quot; room. The alternatives being Sky View, Harbor View, and City View. The distinction between each is a little confusing to me, but I was really happy with our view. We could see both the gardens as well as all the boats docked at sea. I would definitely recommend a Garden/Sea-facing view over the City view because you'll get to see the City view anyway when you visit the pool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The bathroom may have been my favorite part about our stay at the Marina Bay Sands. It felt glamorous and spacious, and the huge bathtub was perfect for a nighttime soak. I also appreciated that the shower and the toilet were in separate rooms. I love full-steam room showers and while I'm not sure if the Marina Bay's set up fully counts as one, it felt close enough to me. They also get bonus points for putting a little bench in the shower room.&lt;/p&gt;

Out of their toiletries I only used the body-wash because I brought my own conditioner/shampoo. It smelled really good but wasn't particularly memorable. I was kind of hoping that a hotel of this caliber would partner with a more well known brand like how the Park Hyatt Tokyo supplies Aesop products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Pool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This is what I came for and it did not disappoint. At first glance the pool seemed smaller than I had imagined but that's because it is broken up into sections. We purposely went both late at night (an hour before closing) and early morning to avoid most of the crowds so we could get less obstructed photos. It was actually a lot colder in the morning despite the sun being out than it was late at night!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/mbs/15.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Hanging off the edge of the pool and seeing all of Singapore before me, it really makes any other infinity pool that isn't paired with that kind of view pale in comparison. Like this is what infinity pools were &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; for. You really do feel like you're on top of the world, and it's hard not to think about how lucky you are to be there. For those who are interested in swimming laps, the most central pool section does have swim lanes in the morning. However, because of the size the pool sections it seems more useful for wading, chilling, and taking in the view rather than active swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Aside from check-in and check-out we didn't have too much interaction with the hotel staff during our one night stay. Everyone was extremely welcoming, and I didn't get any sense of snootiness or sense of not-belonging despite it being a fancier hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Like most hotels the Marina Bay Sands lets you leave your luggage there after check-out if you want to continue exploring the city. Due to their size they have a pretty well-organized coat-check system for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;We didn't eat the hotel because the purpose of our trip was to experience the wonderful street food and hawker centers that Singapore has to offer. However, the Marina Bay Sands does have three restaurants in the SkyPark (where the pool is located). Each of these restaurants offers a breakfast buffet for $45.00 per person unless you specifically buy a fare that includes breakfast with your stay. In the morning when we went to the pool around 9am there was a huge line to enter the nearby buffet, so keep that in mind if you decide to eat at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
There's not much else around the Marina Bay Sands besides other attractions which are a part of the Marina Bay Sands complex, such as its mall, the gardens (with the iconic super trees), and the ArtScience center. I highly recommend going to the ArtScience center and checking out the Future World exhibit (it's great for both kids and adults alike) and it's super convenient that it's so close and walking distance from the hotel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/mbs/19.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
What the immediate area around the hotel lacks in culture it gains in convenient transit. From the Bayfront subway station which connects to the hotel and mall you can easily get to many of Singapore's iconic neighborhoods like Chinatown or Little India. It's also only one transfer away from directly connecting you to Changi Airport. Like most subway systems in Asia it is very clean and efficient, with relatively no delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Marina Bay Sands has elevators for days, facilities for disabled guests and wheelchairs available for rent on a first-come-first-serve basis (though I think you can reserve one in advance). Many of the attractions nearby the hotel are also wheelchair friendly, such as the Gardens by the Bay, ArtScience Museum, and the SkyPark at the top of the hotel. I recommend checking out this helpful &lt;a href=&quot;http://spintheglobe.net/dir/2018/02/27/wheelchair-accessible-things-to-do-singapore/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on wheelchair accessible things to do in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;So is the Marina Bay Sands worth the money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Honestly, it kind of depends on your budget. If you feel like a night here would f*ck with your budget, require extensive saving or financial sacrifices, I wouldn't recommend it because I don't think it would live up to the expectations of the effort it took to stay there. If it weren't for the extravagant pool, the hotel itself is pretty similar to any other business hotel, and you can still access the SkyPark without staying at the hotel. If you do want to go to the pool, keep in mind that during prime time you'll be fighting against the crowds for a good picture. If price is a concern I'd definitely try to go with a group so you can split the rate (just be stealthy as hotels like this often charge a fee when there's more than two people staying in a room), or if you're flexible you can try booking the same day of your stay for a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;If you are typically looking into the $250+ range for lodging anyway, I think that the Marina Bay Sands would be a reasonable expense for access to the pool (think of it like buying a day pass to a hotel pool in NYC on top of your stay). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
As for me, I typically think booking anywhere over $200/night range is a splurge; that's why our recommendations are limited to no more than $300/night. This was definitely an out of the ordinary expense for me but I was willing to make the investment because of this specific project, and to have a hotel like the Marina Bay Sands as a baseline to compare other lodgings to. So now I can say definitively that if you're saving up for that memorable bucket-list experience, I think there are better options out there for a better price.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
For a hotel nerd like me, Palm Springs is like an archaeological site that's just teeming with hotel history. Almost every hotel in Palm Springs has lived multiple lives, starting from the modern oasis' hollywood heyday in the 50's, to a depressing state of decline in the late 80s, and its recent resurgence as a hip and youthful vacation destination. What I love about Palm Springs is that it's particular brand of 'jet-age' mid-century modern is simultaneously a dream of the future and an American vintage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Ace Hotel &amp;amp; Pool Club is arguably the biggest game in town right now when it comes to where to stay— and for a good reason. The spacious suites are reasonably priced, their weekend pool parties are always poppin', and one of the best diners in town is located right on site. Not to knock the Ace but it represents just a small sliver of the magic of Palm Springs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Another interesting thing about Palm Springs is how tightly the vacation rental scene is tied to the hotel scene. The lines are blurred, with rentals offering hotel-quality service and design at a smaller scale. If you're interested in learning more I recommend checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/style/palm-springs-hotels-airbnb-vacation-rental-homes.html&quot;&gt;this New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; from last spring about the recent advent of vacation rentals and the influx of younger tourists in Palm Springs.

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Named after a species of cactus local to Arizona (where the original Saguaro hotel is located), the Palm Springs location is familiar to most due to its rainbow colored walls and poppin' pool parties. What you may not know is that in its previous life, the hotel was actually a Holiday Inn. California-famous boutique hotel group Joie de Vivre brought the Saguaro concept to life in 2012 and last year passed over management to the Sydell Group (responsible for the NoMad hotel in New York and the LINE hotel in Los Angeles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;The Saguaro has wheelchair accessible rooms and facilities with grab rails, lower bathroom sinks, higher level toilets and accessible parking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Like many hotels in Palm Springs, The Lautner has lived many lives. The original property was designed in 1947 by American architect John Lautner, who was also an apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright. It was commissioned by a famous director with the hopes of becoming an escape for the Hollywood elite, but instead sat unoccupied for nearly twenty years. After exchanging hands a few times, in 2008 the property was eventually acquired by an interior and furniture designer duo who renovated and reopened the hotel in Lautner's name. The Lautner is compromised of four units, each with their own micro-kitchen, living area, and a gorgeous mix of wood paneling and cement walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Access to the units requires going down a short flight of interior steps. We recommend directly contacting The Lautner for more information on accessibility. Children or adults under 21 are not permitted at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Ocotillo Lodge is a condiminium complex with a few units available as vacation rentals. Built in 1956, Ocotillo Lodge was the first collaboration between two of the most influential names in Palm Springs real estate: the Alexander Construction Company and architects Dan Palmer and William Krisel. Krisel is often credited with designing the iconic &quot;butterfly roof&quot; spotted all over Palm Springs. The lodge was originally designed with traveling executives in mind, as the Alexanders predicted that Palm Springs would eventually become more than just a celebrity vacation spot, but a year-round business hub too. We recommend Ocotillo Lounge for long-term stays because of the modern and spacious kitchens in each unit and the hefty one-time cleaning fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Ocotillo Lodge does have accessible rooms. Units vary by owner so we recommend checking directly with the host for more accessibility information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This unique home is located in Palm Spring's iconic wind farm, and was originally built in the 1950s as a vacation home. In the 70's the owner purchased a commercially available geodesic dome kit which he installed around the exterior of the home. Curiously, the dome had very few windows and under-utilized the surrounding vistas. A few years ago the home was purchased by an architect who redesigned the dome with more windows and refurnished the home with traditional mid-century furniture. The home can occupy up to 6 guests in 3 bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The Rendezvous B&amp;amp;B was originally opened in 1938 as The Mira Loma and became a popular hideaway for celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Veronica Lake. Each room is uniquely themed and decorated, our favorite being &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, which was originally Marilyn's room of choice. The historic B&amp;amp;B recently added a commercial kitchen in 2008 and of course, breakfast is included with your stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;While almost all of the other hotels on this list are renovations of existing building, Arrive, which opened in 2016, marks the first new construction hotel in Palm Springs in over 30 years. The 32-room hotel was started by two Four Seasons alumni and, surprisingly enough, a few Facebook and Amazon alumni. Which actually kind of makes sense considering the hotel boasts having outlets in all the right places, and text-support for accessing hotel services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;Arrive has facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;For those who feel underwhelmed or exhausted by the mid-century stylings in Palm Springs, look no further than Korakia Pensione for something a little different. The hotel is composed of two restored historic neighboring villas— one built in the Mediterranean style while the other evokes Moroccan architecture and decor. The Moroccan villa was originally the home of a Scottish painter, Gourdon Cotts, who spent much of his early life in Tangier. The Moroccan villa's &quot;Artist Studio&quot; has hosted many famous American artists like Grant Wood, while the Mediterranean Villa's &quot;Delphi Room&quot; is the most affordable unit at the resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebirdhouseelnido.com&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Birdhouse&lt;/a&gt; is a unique &quot;glamping&quot; experience nestled into the foresty hills of El Nido, with treehouse-inspired nests that overlook the breathless Bacuit Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I actually discovered The Birdhouse through the fortuitous magic of SEO. I was in the early stages of planning our trip to El Nido, not yet looking into lodging but doing research on how long our trip should be. I stumbled onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebirdhouseelnido.com/how-many-days-should-i-stay-in-el-nido/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;a blog entry with sample itineraries&lt;/a&gt; and out of curiosity clicked on the domain, only to find the exact type of unique, well-designed lodging that The InnBox is all about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Fast-forward to our trip. We spent first half of our time in El Nido at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/ph/amakan.html?aid=1452227&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;group_adults=1&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Amakan&lt;/a&gt; (review forthcoming). I would've preferred to spend the entire time at The Birdhouse but this place fills up &lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt; and I literally planned our entire Philippines trip around the two nights of availability they had in January. The Birdhouse staff were incredibly communicative in coordinating our arrival— because, yes, it involves some logistics. Let's get into that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The most important thing you need to know about The Birdhouse, logistically, is that it's not located off a major road. There is no door-to-door drop off service. Unless you plan to stay on their grounds for the entirety of your stay (and miss out on all the beautiful El Nido islands) there will be some walking involved to get in and out of The Birdhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We were dropped off at the entrance to Marimegmeg beach, the closest a vehicle can get. Because we coordinated with The Birdhouse, they had two staff members there to greet us and help us out with our bags. We followed them down a set of stairs and across almost the entire length of the crescent shaped beach. We took a left turn behind one of the many beach bars and walked through a cleared path in the forest, across a few small bridges until we hit the foot of the stairs leading up to the Birdhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The first time I took these stairs, I was panting and out of breath. As you ascend you'll come across a few signs with motivational messages like &lt;i&gt;&quot;one step at a time!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&quot;the best is yet to come!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. When we reached the lobby a staffer was waiting with fresh glasses of ice water, which I immediately seized while wheezing out a &quot;thank you&quot; and then chugging for my life. The funny thing is, the climb seemed so much worse the first time we did it (and we weren't even carrying our own bags) but the subsequent two times it really wasn't that bad. It also helped that our tent was located the closest to ground level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Nest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
You might think that being &quot;closest to the ground&quot; meant that we had the worst view, but it was actually the exact opposite. We were already pretty high up off the ground and our &quot;nest&quot;, Number 3, was actually perfectly positioned so that our view of the bay wasn't as obstructed by the trees that shade the rest of the compound. I mean... look at this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
This was my first &quot;glamping&quot; experience so I wasn't sure what to expect but the tent was so much bigger and roomier than I expected. For one, I didn't realize there'd be two additional twin beds inside in addition to the queen bed, meaning each tent can accommodate up to 4. Our room came supplied with some basic amenities: towels and bottled water, and a flashlight in case the generator went out (it didn't during our stay).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Birdhouse is also big on conservation so they only turn on their electricity from 6PM—6AM at night, which is honestly the only time you really need it with most guests off on excursions during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/7.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/9.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I thought the bed was super comfy and each side is flanked by a huge fan. With the fan on at a low setting I felt the temperature was perfectly comfortable for me at nights (and I usually find myself getting either &quot;too hot&quot; or &quot;too cold&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
There's also a significant amount of space outside the tent on your own private wooden platform, including a drying line behind the tent for hanging up any wet clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I love the idea of &quot;glamping&quot;, camping, or generally sleeping in the outdoors. I get excited about that... what I get anxious about is the bathroom sitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We had been warned by the staff not to be freaked out if there were geckos around the bathroom. It's expected, it's normal. I braced myself for it. And yet, I didn't see a single gecko in or around our bathroom during our entire stay! In fact, I saw less crawling critters in our outhouse bathroom at The Birdhouse than I did in our indoor bathrooms at all the other hotels we stayed at in The Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/birdhouse/10.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Honestly, it was fine. The bathroom was cozy, it was cute, and the appliances all seemed up to date and new. The shower water doesn't get very warm but you don't really need it to the kind of weather we had. You'll also be confronted in the bathroom with a lot of signage about conservation and water-use; seriously, the commitment is strong. The owner even mentioned to us that he's looking into switching to solar power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;We got a hint from a fellow guest that the Birdhouse lets you break off a piece of aloe from their plant to treat your burns. When we enquired about it one of the managers came out to help us, cutting off a piece of the plant and showing us how to skin the plant and get the most use out of the aloe. They even let us take it with us on the road, although we had to throw it away before we got to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The owner of the Birdhouse, Mark, is also a friendly face that often pops up during your stay and is happy to chat with guests. He actually greeted us from his spot chilling on the beach during our initial trek to the lodge and not knowing who he was, I thought &quot;wow people in El Nido sure are friendly!&quot; before one of the staffers carrying our luggage explained his presence. His wife, Camille, is responsible for all the stunning interior design at the Birdhouse, and we even befriended the current yoga teacher on-site at one of the local bars— although we never did ended up making it to the free yoga class...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Complimentary breakfast is included at The Birdhouse and they serve a different dish everyday accompanied by fresh fruit, like yellow watermelons, which I'd never had before. The first day we had chorizo, eggs, and garlic rice and the second day we had apple butter toast, which was my favorite of the two breakfasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We also ate at the restaurant for dinner on our first night there (after climbing those stairs we weren't in a hurry to go back down). The food is kind of expensive but it's a bit understandable when you take into consideration the labor and effort to get the necessary ingredients and supplies up there— and the food was good, so that helps! I had the pumpkin vegetable curry which had very generous portions. If you're lucky and it's not too crowded you can grab the one table on the restaurant's balcony for a shady yet unobstructed view of the bay, or chill in the cute lounge area on the balcony for evening drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Birdhouse is located in Corong-Corong, a more sparsely populated area compared to the denser El Nido town. There are tons of beaches, including Marimegmeg beach which is big and gorgeous, and quite a few bars and cafes around the shore. During our stay we even got to go down to a little Full Moon party at one of the beach bars, where tourists and a few locals were all mingling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Since most of the tours in El Nido leave from the beach at El Nido town, it will take a twenty minute drive (included in the cost of most tours) to get there. If you want to experience more diverse dining options its recommended to eat and hang around El Nido town after your day tour before heading back to Marimegmeg beach and The Birdhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
This one kind of goes without saying but... given the trek across the beach and several steep stairs to access The Birdhouse, we really can't recommend it for wheelchair users or anyone who has difficulty walking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you enjoy active vacations and want to experience El Nido to the fullest, I highly recommend staying at The Birdhouse El Nido. It's probably one of the most memorable places I've stayed at, which pushed me a little bit out of my comfort zone while still being a relaxing and inspiring place to put my feet up.

San Francisco is our most requested city to cover, so we're starting out with a deep dive into the city's Airbnb scene. Before moving to New York I spent my first two years out of college living in San Francisco and I'm still nostalgic for the beautifully painted Victorians and breathless bay windows. Not to mention the space! Sure, New York and San Francisco are equally crippling expensive but at least you can rely on San Francisco's California address for a few extra square feet and pleasant weather to distract you from the burning hole in your paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The other good news is that Airbnbs in San Francisco are actually quite reasonably priced. Perhaps the sizable supply, thanks to Airbnb being based there, keeps the rates competitive. It's also generally a better choice to stay in an Airbnb if you want to truly experience the city. Most of San Francisco's hotels are located downtown or near the financial distract and sadly not in its best neighborhoods (we will feature our favorites soon nonetheless). Since there is such  huge inventory of Bay Area bnbs we've limited this list to options within San Francisco city limits, and will touch on Oakland and North / South bay options at a later date!&lt;/p&gt;

This so called tiny house has everything you could ever need or want: big windows, an industrial-inspired kitchen, and minimalist bedroom. The fact that it's surrounded by trees only adds to the charm. This architectural gem is available in limited capacity throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever wandered around the IKEA showroom and wished that your apartment could look like their thoughtfully designed fake apartments? Well, this one actually does. This little studio has a calming vibe, a custom shower with some gorgeous tile work, and is located near two of my favorite small parks: Precita and Bernal Heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Access to this studio requires going up a short flight of 3 steps.&lt;/p&gt;

This studio has a brilliant layout and big windows for soaking up all that California sunshine. There'a also an adorable little breakfast nook in the apartment, which is located at the cross-section of three of my favorite SF neighborhoods: Mission, Noe Valley, and Bernal Heights.&lt;/p&gt;

We love the dark, moody vibes of this abode, which will please any plant lover. The dark wood paneling gives it a cozy, homey feeling, working in favor of the unit's basement level location instead of against it. The unit is located in a renovated 1906 Victorian cottage.&lt;/p&gt;

If dark and cozy basements aren't your thing, then this light-filled top unit may be more up your alley. We love the minimalist, subtly nautical color scheme and the private deck is an added bonus. It's also located in quaint Cole Valley, a neighborhood I always dreamed about living in during my time in San Francisco!&lt;/p&gt;

A gorgeous, light-filled apartment close to Golden Gate Park and the vibrant Inner Sunset neighborhood. We love the white and wooden kitchenette and how the apartment is optimized for storage, making a small space seem even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

This apartment is serving executive realness with its sumptuous velvet and leather accents and splashes of navy blue. The outdoor rooftop dining area looks the most romantic place to enjoy a glass of wine and take in the sweeping views after a long day exploring the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Please enquire directly with the host regarding accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

This spacious Mission apartment is an incredible value, especially when fully occupied. The Airbnb is operated by a French industrial designer, whose taste comes through in the marble countertops and clawfoot bathtubs adorning this gorgeous place. Hosts up to 4 people.&lt;/p&gt;

The San Francisco design aesthetic these days is sunny and minimal— and I love that, but for something a little different, check out the self-proclaimed &quot;ugliest place in the world&quot;, operated by a funny fellow named Merkley. This Airbnb's aesthetic harkens more to the San Francisco of decades past, a little vintage, a little seedy and a little sinful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This airbnb unit is located on the ground floor. It is also pet friendly upon approval.&lt;/p&gt;

This apartment is located in the same area of the Mission I used to live and in and fills me with nostalgia. It's spacious, has a gorgeous and recently updated kitchen, bright-tiled bathroom, and plenty of light. It's also close to so many wonderful places to eat in the East Mission.

Another East Mission abode, although this one is filled with quirky and artful little details and vintage vibes befitting of the neighborhood. The apartment itself also has a huge kitchen island for a group to gather around, and a backyard patio table for dining al fresco. A few scenes from the movie &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; were even filmed in the backyard. Accommodates up to 8.&lt;/p&gt;

Before moving to New York I spent my first two years out of college living in San Francisco and I'm still nostalgic for the beautifully painted Victorians and breathless bay windows. Not to mention the space! Sure, New York and San Francisco are equally crippling expensive but at least you can rely on San Francisco's California address for a few extra square feet and pleasant weather to distract you from the burning hole in your paycheck.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hotel Review: My Love Inn in Lijiang, China</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/my-love-inn-lijiang-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hotel Review: My Love Inn in Lijiang, China" /><published>2018-01-21T11:10:36+07:00</published><updated>2018-01-21T11:10:36+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/my-love-inn-lijiang-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/my-love-inn-lijiang-review/">&lt;div style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;

Tucked into an unassuming alley in Lijiang's quieter and less popular ancient town, Shuhe, is a tranquil, homey, and harmonious little guest house with the most adorable name: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link underline-hover orange&quot; href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/my-love-inn.html?aid=1452227&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;My Love Inn.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blink and you might miss the entrance as I did. The wooden entryway frames a large potted plant against a white backdrop, almost like a piece of art. In addition to starting our stay with a little bit of ambiance, the obscured entrance also provides a sense of privacy. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in an open air courtyard surrounded by wooden slats, ceramic pots, and a shallow pool of water that's home to a handful of tranquil koi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Upon check in we were treated to a tea ceremony inside the lobby— which is less like a traditional hotel lobby and more like a minimalist dining room fit with a long wooden table for entertaining. The tea break was a much appreciated opportunity to catch our breath after pulling our luggage through Shuhe's cobblestone streets (where cars are not permitted). We learned that My Love Inn is, like most guest houses in Lijiang, a family run affair. The dream and vision of a matriarch whose son is now responsible for daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Rooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We were offered a free upgrade to the &quot;superior twin room&quot;. The main difference between that and our originally booked twin room is that it's slightly bigger and has an divider between the seating area and the beds. The divider between the two areas was actually very useful because the entrance to our room opened up into the courtyard. If we wanted to enjoy the daylight and a fresh breeze we could keep the door to our room open while still maintaing privacy behind the divider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The beds were super comfortable and came with electric blankets, which was sooo nice since Shuhe is near a mountainous area and tends to get cold at night. The rooms also come with fluffy robes and free cozy slippers with &quot;My Love&quot; embroidered on them in Chinese (which I took with me and still use at home). I'm pretty sure even without an upgrade we would have enjoyed our original room (the cheapest option at the inn), although if I were ever back in Lijiang I would go ahead and splurge for the Deluxe Family Room on the second floor which looks like the best suite in the joint with its huge glass windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The bathrooms were quite modern in contrast to all the wooden furniture and interiors. The fixtures and appliances were all by Moen or Kohler so, ya know, they got those quality American bathroom products. The bathrooms also have heated tile floors and our room had an enclosed standing shower (some rooms have tubs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The only room for improvement here is that the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a sliding wooden door (like all the doors at the inn). Our door didn't really slide to a snug close which gave me a little bit of anxiety, and it wasn't really soundproof. I would probably for-go the aesthetically consistent choice for a normal hinged door that locks. That said, the sliding door was still an improvement over the other hotel we stayed at in Lijiang where the bathroom was separated by a hanging piece of fabric!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I can't speak highly enough about the service at My Love Inn. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel at home. During our stay my mom got a headache and asked the staff if they had any pain relievers she could buy. They didn't, but a member of the staff personally escorted us to the nearest pharmacy so that she could help my mom translate and pick out the right medication, as well as pay for it. Likewise they were also very hands on in helping us coordinate excursions we had booked outside of the hotel. For context, I speak ~zero~ Chinese and my mom's is very limited from her early childhood growing up in China. The staff were so helpful in coordinating w/ local tour agencies on our behalf and also escorting us to the right pick up areas since vehicles are not allowed in the immediate area around the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/myloveinn/9.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Upon check out they gave us each a parting gift— a box of black sugar, a local specialty which we had seen in various shops around Lijiang. I'm a sucker for foodie gifts— I mean these are the type of things it's hard to justify buying for yourself but make such good presents. I can't say if this is a normal occurrence though or if they just really liked my mom who managed to endear herself to everyone on staff. Either way, it was a great way to end our stay at both the inn and in Lijiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Free breakfast is included daily at My Love Inn and it does not disappoint. The atmosphere and offerings are less continental-breakfast-buffet and more like eating breakfast at a cute cafe, which is actually a cozy sun-dappled room in the inn's entryway. The first night we had heart-shaped fried eggs (adorable!) and congee. The second day they offered us breakfast noodles in a fresh, tomato-y broth that was surprisingly light and clean to the taste. Breakfast also comes with warm soy milk or tea/coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Shuhe is like the Brooklyn to Lijiang's Manhattan. While both are distinguished as &quot;ancient towns&quot;, Shuhe is a little smaller and slower in pace— with wider streets that are far less packed than Lijiang Ancient Town. Instead of chain boutique pastry stores you'll find independent owned fruit carts lining the streets. On the flip side, the dining options are so much more varied in Lijiang Ancient Town. For dinner the majority of restaurants in Shuhe do Hot Pot (which is great! Just maybe not for every meal). Muzi restaurant, located on the edge of town, was a welcome way to change it up with a more diverse menu focused around vegetables. The fare is literal farm-to-table as the restaurant is located across the street from their farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
For this trip I spent half my time in Lijiang Ancient Town and half in Shuhe Ancient Town, though it's more common to stay in one of the ancient towns and do a day trip to the other. Based on the quality of My Love Inn compared to the hotels in Lijiang Ancient Town and Shuhe's relative chill factor, I'd recommend staying there and then day-tripping to Lijiang Ancient Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While most of the rooms are located on the ground floor, access to My Love Inn requires walking and carrying luggage across a few unpaved streets, with many wooden thresholds, which may be inconvenient for wheelchair users or anyone with difficulty walking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I highly recommend staying at the My Love Inn if you ever find yourself in Lijiang. It's been one of the best hotel experiences I've had, at such a humble little place for such a reasonable price.
&lt;/p&gt;
