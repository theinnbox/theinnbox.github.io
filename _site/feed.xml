&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Algarve is a region in the southernmost part of Portugal and home to some seriously beautiful beaches, of which the town of Lagos is particularly famous for. The waters are cool and clear,  and the coast is dotted with massive, majestic rock formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you’re the type to be highly active while traveling then... Lagos &lt;i&gt;isn’t&lt;/i&gt; the place to do that. It is best appreciated by taking things slow and enjoying life, whether you’re staying two nights or an entire week.  The best time to go is mid-May, when the tourism hasn’t kicked in yet and the weather is optimal: cool at night but warm enough during the day to lay on the beach and get a sweet tan. It’s quiet around this time which will give you many more opportunities to explore uninterrupted, with no lines to wait on.  You will find that everything in the Algarve and Portugal in general is extremely affordable, which is one of the reasons why it’s such a popular destination for solo travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Vivenda Solmar is a rarity and the photos do not do it justice. It’s located in a residential area - so it feels like your own home - with close proximity to a beach, while being ultra affordable. I was greeted by a kind host who offered some delicious port wine to sip on while she checked us in.  The room was massive with a balcony that made for some sick views of the ocean.  The cool, dry breeze allowed us to leave the windows open and enjoy the fresh air.  It’s located walking distance to Praia Porto de Mos, which is less crowded and just as beautiful as the other beaches in Lagos.  It’s also away from the city center so it feels remote and peaceful.  The ocean view is simply breathtaking and you will be overcome with emotion when watching the sunset and rise. I highly recommend buying your own groceries and making breakfast in the mornings to enjoy with the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Vivenda Solmar is a three story building with with rooms on the first floor. The entrance is paved, however there are no elevators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If I had wanted to really splurge and treat myself in Lagos, Vila Gale Lagos would have been my top choice.  It’s large, modern, and right by the beach with an epic outdoor pool.  If you’re into resorts, convenience, amenities, and 5 star service, this is the place to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Lagos has a handful of beaches and the best way to explore them is to go on a coastal walking tour.  You can even skip the coast and walk along the sand, through grottos and caves.   There’s a lot of nooks and crannies to explore and the view of it all is simply breathtaking.  If you’re looking for something more secluded I highly recommend Praia do Pinhão.  Getting there requires descending steep stairs that have no handrail and kind of end abruptly.  You’ll end up having to rock climb down a little bit but it’s not too bad and totally worth it.  Whichever praia you go to, there is always a more secluded and secret area that requires a small trek to discover, but is ultimately rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

This is where we ended up when my friend and I were trying to find a place to eat on our first night.  It was May and not yet tourist season so a lot of places were closed, and boy, was that a blessing in disguise.  Otherwise, we wouldn’t have found this gem: &lt;i&gt;Cervejaria Ferradura&lt;/i&gt;.  It’s a small brewery with bar seating only (12 ~ 14 people max) and no menu.  There’s a glass display in the front full of prepared and fresh food and you just kinda point at what you want to eat. This worked out great because we didn’t speak enough Portugese to communicate with the owners and instead had to literally communicate through food. The food was incredible - simple but with so much flavor; fresh, and made only better by the house white wine on tap.  Who knew bread and cheese could be &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; good?  I can definitely say, this was one of the most memorable meals of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 pt4 pb3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'; max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Take a boat ride around Ponta de Piedade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I tend to avoid tourist traps or stereotypical touristy activities — like paying exorbitant fees for gondola rides or riding the tram in Lisbon.  The same &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be said for boat rides at Ponta de Piedade but this is one tourist attraction that’s worth every penny.  It wasn’t THAT expensive but it was expensive compared to everything else I did in Lagos (20 euro per person).  And you know what?  I had a blast.  The boat ride was about 20 minutes and included some exhilarating moments like trying to squeeze into caves so small, we had to duck down in our boats to pass through.  The payoff to that was exploring the cave interiors intimately, and seeing water in a color I didn’t even think was possible.  Our guide spoke a small amount of English, but it was more than enough to effectively share his knowledge of the rock formations.  By boat (kayak or motor) is the only way you can view these natural wonders up close. Afterwards we climbed back up the cliffs and enjoyed an ice cold refreshing Sagres Radler, a lemon-y beer type drink.  So simple but such a great way to end our trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 pt4 pb3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'; max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Eat your weight in seafood (and potatoes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
It’s fresh, it’s plentiful, it’s cheap, and it’s what Lagos does best.  I can honestly say, no matter where you go, it’s gonna be good. A couple I met recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restaurante+O+Camilo/@37.086889,-8.6697266,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xcc3afe433395edac?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwia5J7GwJrcAhWOON8KHeTPBwUQ_BIwDnoECAoQCw&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;O Camilo&lt;/a&gt; which is located by the stairway leading down to Praia do Camilo. It was a bit bougie, but had breathtaking views.  I ordered the mackerel and clams which was un-surprisingly delicious, fresh, and cheap.  The potatoes that came with it were just as delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

For dinner, we checked out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Os+Lambertos/@37.1003456,-8.6788408,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5590e4237bb81ab3?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwif4IKawZrcAhWJdd8KHX17AuQQ_BIwCnoECAoQCw&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Os Lambertos&lt;/a&gt; - a favorite among locals and taxi drivers, known for their down home cooking and traditional Portuguese dishes.  Surprisingly, the non-seafood dish - Portuguese steak with potatoes - was the star.  And the potatoes were damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

I would recommend getting some sort of fresh fish - the flavors are so clean, it’s tender, and never overcooked.  I ordered the sea bream but let me tell you, those potatoes were flavorful AF here too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you’re not too ‘busy’ taking holiday in Lagos, I highly recommend taking surf lessons.  Portugal in general is known to be a surfer’s haven, with some of the best waves in the world.  And there’s nothing like spending the whole day riding then having an ice cold beer afterwards. I decided to holiday like a European this trip, so skipped out on lessons.  But if you’re interested, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesurfexperience.eu/&quot;&gt;The Surf Experience&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 pt4 pb3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'; max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Talk to the locals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
As beautiful as Lagos is, the most beautiful thing about this town were the locals.  They are kind and generous with their knowledge of the area.  To get the most out of your trip here, talk to them, ask questions, and listen. You can learn so much even just from speaking with cab drivers. And I wouldn’t have discovered Os Lambertos had I not asked the locals specifically where they like to eat (as opposed to where I should eat).  It will help you view Lagos through the eyes of its inhabitants and ultimately give you an truly immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I’ll be honest.  I had no expectations for Faro.  From my research it seemed there was really nothing to do - it was just a town.  Thankfully my assumptions were off.  Faro is a town, but it’s meant to be explored and appreciated from an architectural and design standpoint.  The lines, colors, and buildings of Faro are a work of art.  Life is simple and you take things slow. Above are some things I came across on my walk around Faro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Train is the best way to get here from Lagos, and it is an 1hr 40 min ride.  Once you’ve arrived, you’ll be in the heart of the town and can start exploring right away.  Faro also has an airport, which is the only one in the Algarve, so you can fly in from anywhere else in Portugal easily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;If you've been on Netflix lately, you've probably noticed that the romantic comedy is having a comeback (I'm talking about &lt;i&gt;Set It Up&lt;/i&gt;, which is so so good). It's a good thing too because I, for one, am starving for the tastefully decorated apartments and wanderlust-inducing locales that the genre (along with it's parent category, romance) often sweeps us away to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Recently, CN Traveller &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cntraveler.com/story/you-can-rent-the-villa-from-under-the-tuscan-sun?sp=&amp;amp;weekend_photo=2&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;wrote about the gorgeous villa from &lt;i&gt;Under The Tuscan Sun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out you can stay there for real— as long as you've got around twenty friends or family members who are willing to split the $2,391/night fee. For those of us who mostly travel with our partners, our friends, or god forbid— &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;, it's all a bit out of reach. Which is ironic considering that the movie is literally about Diane Lane traveling to Italy &lt;i&gt;by herself&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;So, I thought it would be fun to try to find more affordable approximations of popular romance homes and hotels. Depending on how realistic the original film was, some of these are upgrades. Others are admittedly not as fabulous, but it's not too bad for under $300/night to travel or live like a romantic lead...&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;i&gt;Under the Tuscan Sun&lt;/i&gt; Diane Lane plays a divorcée who spontaneously buys and renovates an Italian villa, and forms all kinds of meaningful relationships in the process. The real life &quot;Villa Bramasole&quot; is actually the expansive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luxuryretreats.com/vacation-rentals/italy/tuscany/cortona/villa-laura-112033&quot;&gt;Villa Laura&lt;/a&gt;, which as I mentioned before, costs a pretty penny. The good news is that yellow tuscan villas are all over Airbnb, and a lot less expensive. My favorite of the options is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9676103?wl_source=list&amp;amp;wl_id=329621833&amp;amp;role=wishlist_owner&amp;amp;adults=1&amp;amp;children=0&amp;amp;infants=0&quot;&gt;Villa La Scuola&lt;/a&gt; at $118 a night. Not only does it have the characteristic yellow and green exterior, the theme is brought inside with bright lemony kitchens and sage accents, plus curved archways separating the rooms. There's even a gorgeous plant covered garden and patio that would be perfect for hosting a small wedding... just sayin'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Villa La Scuola has step-free access, a brightly lit and flat path to the front door, along with a wide doorway.&lt;/p&gt;

The movie musical that launched a thousand trips to Greece. In the movie, Meryl Streep's character Donna runs the dreamy Hotel Bella Donna, perched at the top of a cliff on the Greek island of Skopelos. Unfortunately there is no &quot;real&quot; Hotel Bella Donna as it was just a set, though there is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holidayislands.com/skopelos/houses/pyrgos/&quot;&gt;&quot;Hotel Pyros&quot;&lt;/a&gt; located nearby, where Meryl Streep would rest between filming. But while stunning in its own way, Pyros' stony interiors doesn't quite invoke the bright, airy and optimistic charm of the Bella Donna. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2863822?wl_source=list&amp;amp;wl_id=329621833&amp;amp;role=wishlist_owner&amp;amp;adults=1&amp;amp;children=0&amp;amp;infants=0&quot;&gt;This Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; on Skopelos at $42/night however hits all the right notes: bright white walls with pops of blue, perfectly lived in furniture that looks like it came out of an &lt;i&gt;Anthropologie&lt;/i&gt; catalog, and shuttered windows you can dramatically throw open and sing your heart out of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This airbnb has a well-lit path to its entrance but relies on stairs to access bedrooms on the upper floors.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;i&gt;Leap Year&lt;/i&gt;, Amy Adams hires a surly Irishman played by Matthew Goode to drive her across the country so she can propose to her boyfriend in Dublin. Naturally, hijinks and sexual tension ensue. In one of the more memorable scenes, Adams and Goode have to share a tiny bed in a cozy countryside cottage, as they must convince the conservative innkeepers that they're married. You know, classic rom-com problems. While the film's bed and breakfast was a set, you can find many similar homes in Tipperary, Ireland— like &lt;a href=&quot;Geoghegans Old Stone Cottage&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;this Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; for $67/night. It's got a fire place, cozy leather couches and red accents, plus the bed is honestly an upgrade from the one in the film. Even better, you'd have the place all to yourself— no nosy innkeepers in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This entire Airbnb unit is a single story, however its entrance is unpaved.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;i&gt;The Notebook&lt;/i&gt;, Ryan Gosling builds Rachel McAdams a house even though they haven't been together in years. Sorry, it's not &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; a house— it's her dream home, a symbol of his love, and an entire generation's unrealistic expectations. The actual house that was used in the film is Martin's Point Plantation and is a private residence on Wadmalaw Island in South Carolina. The owners have apparently had to deal with many fans wandering onto their property, much to their annoyance. Instead of trespassing you can find a little southern hospitality at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14995365&quot;&gt;this Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;, also located on Wadmalaw Island. Similar to the original it has white clapboard siding, shuttered windows, a gorgeous porch perfect for painting on, and lots of wooden furniture and accents. You can fit up to ten guests here for $200/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;In order to access this home you must climb stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;In The Mood For Love&lt;/i&gt; follows two neighbors in 1960's Hong Kong who both suspect their spouses are having an affair— with each other. So much of the film is dominated by punchy colors and patterns; deep reds, oranges, and splashes of purple. Much of it also takes place in homes and hotel rooms. The film was actually mostly shot in Bangkok, and of the few scenes shot in Hong Kong, many of the locations have changed dramatically since  the movie was released in 2000. That's what makes finding an approximate Airbnb somewhat difficult. The set design for &lt;i&gt;In The Mood For Love&lt;/i&gt; is very representative of its time and today, bold graphic wallpaper has been replaced with minimalism and large glass windows. However, you can find the best of both worlds— that's the film's signature color and patterns with today's modern luxury— at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&amp;amp;cid=1801609&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=3494&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Luxe Manor&lt;/a&gt; hotel in the Kowloon area of Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;i&gt;Notting Hill&lt;/i&gt; Hugh Grant plays Will, the owner of a travel bookstore (be still my heart) who meets and forms a relationship with a famous actress played by Julia Roberts. Several pivotal scenes take place in Will's Notting Hill flat— which looks like a charming yet realistically lived-in bachelor pad. The apartment's exterior is known for its iconic blue door, which in real life belonged to the film's screenwriter. Finding an apartment that looks like Will's today is a bit challenging, as it such a product of its time and that time was the late 90's. It's an aesthetic that most of Notting Hill's tasteful Airbnb hosts seem to want to avoid today. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10088507&quot;&gt;this unit&lt;/a&gt; for $215/night comes close. It has a very similar layout to Will's apartment with a thin kitchen and large glass windows at the end of the room for tons of light. It's even got a blue door like the original, and blue walls on the interior to suit the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;There are a few small steps from the apartment's entryway into the kitchen, but we recommended reaching out directly to the Airbnb host for more accessibility information..&lt;/p&gt;

The eponymous lake house is probably one of my favorite movie homes of all time. They custom-built the steel and glass home from scratch for the film after weeks of location scouting around Chicago and failing to find an existing building that met their needs. The architects claim that the house was inspired by 1960's glass houses, the Regency period, as well as greenhouses. They were able to film the movie at Maple Lake near Chicago under the agreement that the lake be returned to its prior condition after filming wrapped— which meant demolishing the lake house, much to everyone's disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;For my affordable alternative I may have cheated a little. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.candlewoodcabins.com/meadowhouse&quot;&gt;Candlewood Cabins' Meadow House&lt;/a&gt; is a gorgeous square glass building, raised slightly above the ground with rustic yet minimal wooden interiors, just like the one from the movie. No, it's not on a lake, but it is right by a river and a pond. But to be fair, even an actual film crew and professional location scouts couldn't find something like this on an actual lake. Candlewood Cabins is about 3.5 hours out of Chicago, across the Wisconsin border. The Meadow House's rates are currently $195/night but will go up to $245 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Access to Meadow House requires ascending a flight of stairs from an unpaved road.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out, Diane Lane characters have really great— and really expensive— taste in where to stay. In &lt;i&gt;Nights in Rodanthe&lt;/i&gt; Lane's character is operating her friend's bed and breakfast, an iconic and towering building right on the seashore in North Carolina's outer banks, with shingled siding and beachy blue interiors. The original building was built in the 1980s and was condemned and deemed unsafe by local officials shortly after filming. A year after the film was released a couple that claim to be huge fans of the movie purchased the inn and actually had the entire building physically relocated to a safer beachfront location. The inn is now known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunrealtync.com/outer-banks/rodanthe-nc-rentals/oceanfront/r-51
&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Inn at Rodanthe&lt;/a&gt; and you can stay there for $1995/week, with a one week minimum stay. Or, you can make your way a little further up the banks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13980800&quot;&gt;this Airbnb in Kill Devil Hills&lt;/a&gt; for $115/night. While you're staying there you can just imagine that they remade the film today except with Diane Lane as a millennial tending to her friend's two-bedroom Airbnb and it'll all make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Tucked away from the dusty, bustling streets of Siem Reap is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&amp;amp;cid=1801609&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=1119219&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Aviary Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, a 25 room boutique hospitality complex. While it appears girded and minimal on the outside, to step across the hotel's threshold is to gain access to a hidden paradise with an aquamarine pool, lush fauna, and world class amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Our experience with The Aviary Hotel began as soon as we were greeted by the hotel's resident remork driver at the airport. For those unfamiliar, the remork is Cambodia's motorcycle-based vehicle of choice (similar to Thai tuk tuks). The airport is conveniently located only twenty minutes away from the city proper, and at $6 total each way their transfer service is definitely worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/03.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Upon arriving at the hotel, which is sort of tucked into a lot behind a bank, we were greeted with cold lemongrass scented towels and icy glass of tamarind juice. After pulling up our booking information the receptionist gave us some information about the tour packages offered through the hotel. Since we came to Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat we booked their &quot;mini-tour&quot; package for $17 (which by the way is not 'mini' at all) and then she escorted us to our room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Aviary has three tiers of rooms (standard, deluxe, and suites on their top floor). Since this was a short trip I opted for the standard room, their cheapest offering at $73/night. The room was fairly standard in size but felt airier because of the way the hotel utilizes the space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/04.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
For example, one thing I appreciated is that the room had both a bench for storing luggage &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a proper seating area. Usually hotels only have one or the other and as a result my luggage ends up taking precedence. There was also enough room for a coffee table infront of the cushioned bench, another detail that made the room feel bigger than its 35 square meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/07.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/06.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The room follows the hotel's bird theme, and while I was worried it could go a little overboard and into &quot;put-a-bird-on-it&quot; Etsy-style territory, I think they did a good job in keeping the avian theme feeling fresh and playful. I loved the bird-cage inspired lamps and glossy red sculptures dotting the room. If you've been following this blog then you probably know I feel... &lt;i&gt;a way&lt;/i&gt; about wall decals so I was less thrilled about that decorative choice but at least these were metal sculptures mounted on the wall as opposed to vinyl. The metal work is by local non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theironworkshop.org/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Iron Workshop&lt;/a&gt; while the textiles are by Siem Reap fashion designer Eric Raisina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/08.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Our room also included a balcony with a great view of the interior courtyard and pool. The one thing though is that in all their official photos, the balconies look a lot more fleshed out than in reality. The photos depict a comfortable looking sofa and a lot more foliage and in reality it's a lot more minimal with a lime green table and chairs. I noticed all of the other balconies in the interior courtyard had the same set-up while the balconies on the hotel's exterior had sofas. The interior courtyard is definitely the better view so I'm kind of okay with this in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Bathroom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Okay first of all, the water pressure in this hotel is noticeably amazing. The rainfall shower felt more like a waterfall, although the design of the shower itself is pretty basic. The bathroom also comes equipped with a tub and complimentary lemongrass bath salts, along with a little peek-a-boo window facing the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fn center mb3 mb4-ns tc&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/09.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Another nice detail in the bathroom is the inclusion of a little stool— a convenient surface for a glass of wine or additional toiletries beside the bath, and just a nice place to perch while you brush your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/10.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/11.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This is where the hotel really shines. For a pool without a view, this was certainly one of my favorites— helped in part by the fact that it felt private because no one else was using it when I was. The pool design gives off a very natural vibe thanks to the stone-textured tiles, the polished rocks bordering the pool, and the wooden deck around it. The look is finished off by all the plants hanging from the balconies above, which make you feel more like you're in the jungle near Angkor Wat than in the bustling town of Siem Reap. Another cool thing is that if you float on your back in the pool and gaze upwards at the sky you will probably see some perfectly silhouetted birds fly by— a little nod to the hotel's namesake.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/13.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/14.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Another nice touch was that each lounge chair came with its own cute little sun hat. There's also a shower for rinsing in the pool area too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The hotel also has a spa on the top floor, the Amaret Spa. While the prices are reasonable (particularly relative to anything you'd find in the United States, Western Europe, and even Bangkok) we actually ended up finding a great spot called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samathispa.com/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Samathi Spa&lt;/a&gt; around the corner from the hotel with the &lt;i&gt;exact&lt;/i&gt; same offerings and menu, down to the copy, for less. The spa same package we bought at Samathi for a massage and body wrap for $40 would've been $55 at the hotel so if you're willing to walk one or two minutes around the corner there's discounts to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/15.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The Aviary Hotel takes its bird theme seriously— maybe a little &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; seriously— when it comes to their dining facilities. There's The Flock Cafe, Plumage Restaurant, and then Glide Bar and keeping track of the differing opening/closing hours and happy hour times between them was a little confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/16.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/19.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The Glide Bar was really cute though. Unfortunately it had just rained when we went up there so we couldn't enjoy the outdoor space but the bar's indoor area is a small glass box that feels very intimate. They make some beautiful craft cocktails priced between $5 and $6 and also bring out complimentary bar snacks, including these sugared pieces of fried garlic which blew. my. mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Breakfast was included with our rate and taken in the Plumage Restaurant. Included in the free breakfast is your choice of a made to order entree as well as any additional accompaniments you might find in a continental breakfast like toasts, jams, and cereal. The breakfast also includes your choice of a drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/21.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/22.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I ordered a pineapple juice which seemed to also include a hint of turmeric. It was delicious. For my entree I ordered the eggs benedict and asked for one singular egg which may have been a mistake. The eggs benedict didn't include any protein or spinach so it was really just a poached egg on a slice of baguette with some hollandaise sauce. Knowing that I probably would've asked for two or ordered something else. My boyfriend ordered a more traditional Cambodian soup and actually thought it was one of the best things he ate during our entire time in Siem Reap, so perhaps it's better to err on the side of more traditional fare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;We didn't end up eating any meals at The Flock Cafe, which is an on-site cafe that is open to the public. However we did take advantage of the fact that after 6pm all of their baked goods get marked 50% off. I bought a discounted passion fruit tart there which was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The service at The Aviary Hotel was seriously impressive. It felt like I was staying at a hotel much more expensive than the $73/night we paid for it. Every time we exited or entered the hotel someone would run over to open the door for us (which admittedly, may have been a little excessive at times but appreciated nonetheless), and same for entering and exiting the dining room. Everyone was super friendly from the receptionist to the bar tender to our remork driver. When we went on our tour to Angkor Wat with the same driver he came prepared with a cooler filled with ice cold water and wet wipes and would offer us both every time we came back from seeing a different temple. I noticed that this wasn't super common as many of the other remorks driving tourists around the temples didn't seem to have coolers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/25.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;*extremely Miss Vangie voice* Get these cookies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Their turn-down service is also especially cute and comes with complimentary cookies. I did find it amusing that they have to specifically tell you NOT to take the cookie jar, as if that's been a problem in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The hotel is pretty much perfectly located in my opinion. It's in a much more central area than many of the bigger hotels and resorts in town, and therefore is much more conveniently located near many great restaurants, nightlife, and the local night market. Despite being in a busier area, because the hotel isn't sitting right on the street but rather hidden a little further back in an alley, there wasn't much of an issue with noise at night.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Similarly, the hotel is located about a five minute walk away from Pub Street, an almost maze-link area of small streets filled with bars— but also far enough away that you could completely avoid the area if you wanted to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/23.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/24.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
In the center of the hotel is a spacious glass elevator which goes to all floors, and the hallways and doorways to each room all seemed quite wide. I think the biggest concern wheelchair users will face is less inside the hotel than out of it— the sidewalks and streets in the area around the hotel aren't in the best condition and during rainy season the streets can easily get flooded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/aviary/26.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I would highly recommend The Aviary Hotel to anyone visiting Siem Reap. I think it's already such a good deal at its cheapest price point but even the upgrades are really affordable. If you wanted to go all out and book the most expensive room in the joint, this is a place where you could do it and it would still be a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
One of the most stressful aspects of planning a vacation is figuring out your itinerary. If you're like me then you may feel pressured to pack as much as possible into your trip in order to justify the financial investment— but bouncing around from one tourist site to another is no fun either and takes time away from one of the best parts of traveling: stumbling upon your own serendipitous discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
This stress is especially maximized if your trip is time-boxed due to your work schedule. Over the years I've come to fall back on a few patterns which have helped me balance the desire to &quot;see it all&quot; with my desire to relax while I'm on vacation. I hope these tips are helpful to anyone else who feels overwhelmed when planning itineraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;1. Identify legitimate &quot;FOMO&quot; from forced &quot;FOMO&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
90% of travel writers are going to tell you to skip any popular tourist attractions on the basis of it being too crowded, or &quot;ruined&quot;. I actually have an issue with this hipster approach to travel. Some places are popular &lt;i&gt;for a reason&lt;/i&gt; and you shouldn't deprive yourself of an experience just because other people want to experience it too. Approaching popular attractions with the positive mindset that I'm going to experience this place with other humans from all around the world usually makes me a little more zen about dealing with crowds. Now, while crowds don't bother me as much, lines and exorbitant entrance fees do. I still need a way to suss out what's worth the time and the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl pb2 w-100&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/01.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;Hanging with the crowds at Pai Canyon. Still 100% worth coming here to view the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
My rubric for sussing out what's worth it usually comes down to: &lt;b&gt;is this a place I can experience beyond just looking at it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Do I have some understanding of the history and context of the place I'm visiting, or is it interactive in some way that makes physically going there different from looking at a picture or admiring it from afar?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Statue of Liberty is a good example. Personally I've always been more satisfied with taking the free Staten Island ferry across the river to get a good view of the statue without having to actually &lt;i&gt;go there&lt;/i&gt;. However, if my ancestors came to America through Ellis Island then I might have the historical and cultural context which would make physically going there more meaningful for me. So what's &quot;worth visiting&quot; is really a personal question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/02.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/03.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;Crowds on the beach at James Bond Island (photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/wangjs/2070015107/in/photolist-49VnnD-iGb2X5-qSf1U7-bzhZFv-df6isD-iG8ona-dt1ktv-iGckEu-ERpNyx-df6iuS-df65wp-df5iwA-bYAZo7-df57xH-df65F2-df57pq-df6inV-df6PkC-df5XBw-bYB56Q-df5XvK-df4TmW-df5qpW-df6dF3-49Vnsk-df5xw3-df6P3t-df6c51-97S7kY-fTSuu-df5Xpz-df6NMD-97NWo8-97P5fB-df6NXM-df65Kg-df5HfL-df6Dfx-df5abj-97S9Ms-97P1ki-W76uSG-df6NJT-df5JpP-df6pC1-df5aiF-4LXfnP-dxHTu3-df5qtC-df6bXn&quot;&gt;Jiashang&lt;/a&gt;) vs James Bond Island II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Another example is James Bond Island near Phuket, which is popular because of the film &lt;i&gt;The Man with the Golden Gun&lt;/i&gt;. I'll admit, I experienced FOMO over this one after seeing stunning photos of it on Instagram. Then I realized that this place is &lt;i&gt;packed&lt;/i&gt; all day long and you can't really go up to the island, just look at it from the nearby beach. To me, this experience was the equivalent of looking at a photo. Instead, we chose to go on an evening tour which purposely by-passes James Bond Island. We didn't choose the tour for this reason but as a bonus it did take us to &quot;James Bond Island 2&quot; which may be less gravity-defying but also less crowded and allowed us to kayak right up to it. As a part of that tour we also got to see (and wave our hands through) bio-luminescent sea plankton, an experience you can't get from a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;2. Travel ethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Putting an emphasis on traveling ethically is another way to cut out a lot of &quot;popular&quot; attractions without any qualms about missing out. As a result of this mindset I didn't swim with the whale sharks in Cebu, one of the most popular things to do on the island, but as a result I had the time to visit an additional island in The Philippines. We also ended up not visiting a waterfall in Koh Samui because of it's affiliation with an exploitive elephant riding tour, which in turn left us with a lot more time to chill on the beach. Similarly, I personally didn't feel comfortable visiting any plantations in Savannah which made the pace of my short two day trip there a lot more relaxing in more ways than one. Choosing to abstain from an attraction because it is endangering animals or profitting off of people's pain is a much better reason than just because &quot;other people like this thing&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;3. Treat down time like it's an attraction worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/04.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;Panglao Beach in The Philippines. We had nothing planned after arriving on the island of Bohol so we wandered over to the nearby beach to check it out and witnessed one of the most stunning sunsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
For me, &quot;down-time&quot; doesn't mean doing nothing. It's just a block of time with nothing specific scheduled in it. People do this often at work— blocking out a chunk of time so colleagues wouldn't schedule meetings over it. I usually like to dedicate at least one day in every city I visit to this. It's become the equivalent of a sight I need to see when I travel. I'd like to experience what it would be like to live in the place I've traveled to, at least for one day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
&quot;Travel days&quot;, a.k.a. the days you arrive and depart a location are ideal for this. You're already probably wiped from your journey so you want to relax anyway. If you're arriving it's the perfect time to get acquainted with the new place without the stress of needing to get somewhere on time, and likewise it's a nice buffer on your way out to prevent yourself from overextending and then rushing to catch your flight/boat/train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;4. Arrive early, leave late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
With this in mind, I usually try to arrive early in the morning (even if that means taking a red-eye) and departing late in the evening in order to maximize the time that I have in that place. Since I stay in so many hotels this is also a way for me to maximize that expense, by having more time to utilize the facilities. When we have a late flight we're usually able to store our luggage at the hotel and then go do stuff for the rest of the day. Although in situations where we've stayed at an Airbnb and might need to carry our stuff around with us I always advocate for traveling for backpacks over suitcases when possible. I've also written before about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sabrinam13/19-things-that-make-traveling-alone-a-lot-less-stressful?utm_term=.pxDVlQlxN#.iqOBV0V3X&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;why backpacks are better for solo travelers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/05.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;A night hike in Seoul, done a few hours before an 11PM departing flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Another added bonus of the arrive early / leave late philosophy is that it scores you two extra meals wherever you're traveling to, which is very important if like me you travel to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;5. Think of countries regionally rather than as one singular entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Something I struggled with when I first started traveling was this idea that I would only go to a certain country or city once in my lifetime. I felt like with limited funds and a whole world out there to see, I couldn't go back to the same place twice which made me feel like I really had to hit up all those famous landmarks. Something that helped me get over this was to think of my destinations more in terms of regions or neighborhoods than specific attractions or sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;If I focused too much on specific sites I would end up with a very scattered itinerary and a lot of time wasted traveling from place to place. When I focus on a region this is inclusive of both the tourist sites within that region but also the time to discover daily life in that location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/06.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;An adorable dessert shop in Phuket Old Town we stumbled upon during &quot;down time&quot; shortly after arriving in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Thailand is a great example. It's a really popular itinerary to hop from Bangkok to Chiang Mai in the north to one of the southern islands in order to get a little taste of everything Thailand has to offer. I think this can work &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; you have a significant amount of time but for those taking vacation days off from work I actually think it's better to pick one region and experience everything there because whether you go north, south, or central, there will be no shortage of beautiful sights and tasty food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Thinking of things regionally has helped me curb this notion of not wanting to go back to somewhere I've already been. It's less &quot;I've already been to Thailand&quot; and more &quot;I've been to Northern Thailand, next time I want to go to the South&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;6. Plan a circular itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you are going to visit multiple sites in a day, multiple neighborhoods in a weekend, multiple cities in a trip, it's usually better to plan a circular route than to travel back and forth from a central location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Even though conventional knowledge is that round trip flights are cheaper than one way, it's usually not that &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; cheaper and you can save a few hours with a more streamlined path. This also applies to where you're staying. In big metropolitan areas like Seoul I'll even plan to move hotels or airbnbs so that I can more conveniently explore different neighborhoods instead of having to go back and forth. The added bonus is that I get to stay in more cute places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/07.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;I arrived in Flam after taking a train from Oslo and transferring to a smaller train. Rather than repeating my steps to get back on the train track to Bergen I decided to take a ferry directly from the port in Flam instead, which also offered me an up close view of the fjords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;When I was in Norway I visited Oslo, Bergen, and Tromsø. It would've been a little cheaper to fly back to Oslo from Bergen and then get on another flight to Tromsø, but instead I paid a little bit more for a direct flight and got my first experience flying on a propeller plane as a result. Which kind of leads me to my next point...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;6. View your mode of transportation as an excursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/08.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;Taking a rocky boat ride to Ometepe island in Nicaragua; riding a cable car to Lantau Island in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;As they say: it's about the journey not the destination. When you're visiting another country, if you plan to visit more than one city you are inevitably going to spend a lot of time in transit. If you can make that mode of transportation something novel, something that's exciting and fully a part of the experience, then you won't feel like you're wasting time in transit. For me, personally, boat rides are always exciting. It's just not something I do every day so I don't mind taking ferries to get around. Even when they're slightly unpleasant and I feel seasick, I feel like it's a part of the experience. For folks who don't fly often, getting on an airplane may provide a similar feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 pb2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/seeitall/10.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tc mid-gray mb3 mb4-ns i f7&quot;&gt;Gamcheon Cultural Village in Busan, South Korea. Tourist-y? Yes. Worth it? Yes. Plus conveniently located on a circuit with fellow attractions Taejongdae Park and BIFF Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I hope this helps reduce some of the stress and anxiety associated with planning itineraries, but if all else fails just remember this: you're going somewhere different from your day to day so it's going to be exciting no matter what. Even if you don't see any major tourist attractions. Even if it that's all you see. At the end of the day it's still a vacation and the only way you can mess that up is if you forget to delete Slack from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f3 pt3 pb3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Why go to Portland?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The two things I get the most excited about when I travel are 1.) Food and 2.) Nature— Portland, Maine has both of those in spades. The city has a reputation for being a foodie paradise, and is rumored to have more restaurants per capita than other city in the U.S. after San Francisco (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-27050-whats-with-all-the-thai-restaurants-in-portland.html&quot;&gt;a surprising amount of Thai restaurants&lt;/a&gt;). For nature, simply get in your car and drive in either direction on the coastal Route 1: going south will take you the most photographed lighthouse in America and seaside lobster rolls at Cape Elizabeth, as well as the dog-friendly beaches of Kennebunkport. Head north and do a little shopping at L.L. Bean HQ before continuing on your way to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. August also marks blueberry season— and you'll find the sweet wild Maine blueberries jammed or embedded into baked goods all along the coast.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tc f3 pt3 lh-title&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Where to Stay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
In addition to places to stay near Downtown Portland, we've included recommendations in Kennebunkport because their lodging game is &lt;i&gt;on point&lt;/i&gt;. Kennebunkport is a 20 minute drive away from Portland and ideal for those who prefer more of a small seaside town feel as opposed to Portland's urban New England vibes. Rates are based on a one-night search for August 2018. The InnBox may collect a share of sales from booking links on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Portland's current boutique hotel darling (think the east coast equivalent of Portland, Oregon's Ace Hotel). The hotel occupies the former Portland Press Herald Building and channels its publishing past into the decor— with gorgeous desks and leather writing chairs (perfect for work-from-hotel types), herringbone textures, and letterpress references abound which should please aspiring writers and typography nerds alike. The hotel is a part of Marriott's Autograph collection and if you book directly through their site you can take advantage of their 'flexible booking' feature which shows you the lowest rate for each month.&lt;/p&gt;

Sophie's South Portland apartment is a case study in doing Airbnb right. An affordable, unique, dog-friendly space in a convenient location with a friendly and communicative host who even drops off bagels for guests. This was where we stayed during our trip to Portland and I highly recommend it. Sophie's place comes in three different configurations— large groups can book the whole place while couples can book the individual floors. We opted to stay on the second floor which was more spacious and next to the gorgeous, shared kitchen space (we actually never encountered any other guests while using the kitchen so it felt very private to us). What I loved about the space was that even though the kitchen was technically shared our space had its own private living and dining area outside of the bedroom. Street parking was free and readily available right behind the apartment, and it was only a 5-10 minute drive across the bridge to anywhere we wanted to go in Downtown Portland. Your stay also comes with a free yoga class at the studio on the first floor but we were too busy to take advantage of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This airbnb is located on the second and third floor of a building and only accessibly by a stairway.&lt;/p&gt;

The Mercury Inn is a modern take on the classic bed and breakfast with a focus on sustainability. It's operated by a pair of charming husbands who channeled their combined interests in Greco-Roman mythology, food, and hospitality into this project. It's also pretty cool that the philosophy for the Mercury Inn was informed by one of the owner's experiences working as an intern in homeless shelter communities, &quot;learning what people require fundamentally to feel safe and comfortable in a space that is not their own&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;All rooms are located on the second and third floor of the building, with no elevator access.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll admit— I'm not the biggest fan of the traditional bed-and-breakfast aesthetic. They can sometimes feel a bit stuffy and outdated. However, Pomegranate Inn manages to take the classic Victorian vibe and make give it a fresh twist thanks to bold wallpaper, painted walls, and playful pattern mixing. The Inn is located in downtown Portland's West End neighborhood, which has been called &quot;one of the best preserved Victorian neighborhoods in the country&quot; by the Minnesota Star Tribune. It is also one of the most gay-friendly neighborhoods in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;There doesn't appear to be elevator access at Pomegranate Inn, but we recommend contacting the hotel directly for more accessibility details.&lt;/p&gt;

The perfect place for living out your fantasy of shacking up in a charming seaside cottage à la Diane Lane in &lt;i&gt;Nights in Rodanthe&lt;/i&gt;. Okay, her inn was a lot bigger, but you get the idea. These petite cottages are embued with tons of charm, dreamy robin's egg blue exteriors, and the small size will feel right at home to urban dwellers. Cabot Cove, itself a body of water, inspired the name of the fictional &quot;Cabot Cove&quot; seaside town setting in the famous series Murder, She Wrote. But don't worry, unlike its fictional counterpart the real Cabot Cove is &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; safe and idyllic. Book three months out for the best rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f6 i light-silver pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
All of the cottages are located on the ground floor.&lt;/p&gt;

This is our top pick for dog owners! While Maine is generally very dog-friendly, there are many hotels who simply tolerate your pup's presence in exchange for a hefty fee— but it seems like the staff at Captain Jeffers truly love dogs and get that our pups are part of our family. The Inn has a carriage house with five dog friendly units, and an additional fee of $35 per dog per day which is actually very reasonable as many other hotels are in the $50-75 range. The fee covers cleaning but also some bonuses for your pet: a personalized dog treat, doggy bowls, towels/sheets, and as many pick up bags as you need. The hotel also offers in-room dog-sitting at $15/hour.&lt;/p&gt;

This picturesque port town hotel will make you feel like you're crashing at your friend's rich New England parent's house. The hotel has an amazing outdoor patio space for entertaining, and a very tasteful application of a nautical color scheme. There are older, more traditional bed-and-breakfast style rooms available as well as rooms with a more modern interpretation of the theme.
Your stay also comes with complimentary use of the beach cruiser bicycles on site, which you can use to navigate around Dock Square, the central area in Kennebunkport where the hotel is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you've been following The Innbox for awhile now, you've probably picked up on the fact that I'm not a big fan of resorts. My main reasons for avoiding them being that they are expensive, often devoid of any personality, and too insulated from the actual place you're there to visit. I know, I know, &lt;i&gt;#notallresorts&lt;/i&gt;— that's exactly what this review is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Since my birthday was coming up, I really wanted to treat myself. What would make a self-proclaimed hotel nerd happier than spending the entire day in a beautiful, well designed space? Though I've stayed in many hotels over the years, I'm always balancing time relaxing at the place I'm staying at with adventuring out into the city I'm visiting. This time, I didn't want to feel pressured to go outside. I wanted to just be able to fully relax and enjoy myself. Which is when it started to occur to me... &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; might be why some people do the resort thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
It kind of makes sense, right? If you're going to spend the money to stay at a resort, you might as well... &lt;i&gt;stay&lt;/i&gt; at the resort. We still booked a few days in Phuket at a cheaper hostel for the days when we would actually go out and explore the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I decided on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&amp;amp;cid=1801609&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=89341&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;SALA Phuket&lt;/a&gt; because it was an outlier in my research. Most of the resorts in Phuket that actually had unique, interesting looking suites were generally in the over $450/night range. While the more affordable resorts all had that standard sleek, minimalist look which I know I could experience at the average hotel for much less. I liked the SALA's use of patterns and their beautiful balance of indoor and outdoor spaces. I also liked that SALA is a home-grown Thai hospitality company, as opposed to the plethora of international chains that have made their way to Phuket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We arrived at the Sala Phuket at exactly 4 PM— their designated check-in time. After being greeted with a refreshing glass of lemongrass iced tea and a short wait, we were escorted to our suite by one of the hotel staff. They gave us a quick tour of the premises and then left us to enjoy ourselves in our new space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
In case guests arrive before 4 PM, the hotel also has a designated guest lounge and library for people to hang out in while they wait for their room to be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Suite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Sala Phuket offers a vast range of different room options, from the most affordable balcony rooms (starting at a little over $112/night) to expansive two-bedroom pool villas (up to $450). We opted for the Sala Pool Suite, the resort's most popular option at just under $250/night which nabs you a glamorous little enclave with its own private pool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Upon entering the suite the first thing we saw was its centerpiece— a bright blue pool that's the perfect size for two to four people to comfortably enjoy. Directly across from the entrance is a narrow, glass windowed building which serves as the suite's bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The bedroom has an extremely spacious layout: there's a large king bed right in the middle of the room, with plenty of space for a desk on one side of it and a sofa and coffee-table on the other. There is a narrow walkway behind the bed reserved for the mini-bar as well as closet space. I was relieved to find that one of the closets had a full-length mirror in it; an amenity that should be guarantee but isn't always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Like many hotels in Asia, electricity in the suite is controlled by your key. While inside we always managed to stay comfortably cool thanks to the 5-speed fans, which can be controlled for either side of the room. The room's small living area also includes a comfortable sofa which I could easily see being used as an additional bed for a small child. In the middle of the day when it was too hot to be outdoors we retreated inside the breezy bedroom and spent the next few hours lounging around watching cable TV movies on the flatscreen before it was cool enough for another dip in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Bathroom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The outdoor bathroom is one of the suite's highlights— particularly the glamorous soak tub that overlooks the pool. The  tub even comes stocked with Himalayan bath salts and a tray that's perfect for balancing a glass of wine or a book on while you enjoy your soak. The only downside to the bath situation is that because it's so big, it took a considerable amount of time to fill the tub with water.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/14.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
For quicker rinses there's also an outdoor shower on a wooden platform to the right of the bath tub. There's an optional privacy curtain you can use around it if needed, although when not in use it adds to the suite's palatial ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/16.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/15.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Kitty corner from the shower is the outdoor toilet, which feels quite private thanks to its clever placement. It's also conveniently located by one of the side doors in the bedroom suite for quick access. The only downside to the outdoor toilet situation is, unsurprisingly, the potential for unwanted 'guests'. In the middle of the night I woke up really needing to go and came outside to find a huge cicada just chilling in front of the toilet. I tried to hold it for another ten minutes, hoping the bug would go away on its own. I tried to flap a towel at it and it wouldn't move. Eventually I had to resort to swiftly reaching around and grabbing the bum-gun (that's the water hose next to most toilets in Asian countries) and forcefully spray the cicada off the platform and back into the nearby bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I do want to make it clear though that despite the unwanted intruder, the bathroom is &lt;i&gt;impeccably&lt;/i&gt; clean. Cleaner than many indoor bathrooms in hotels I've stayed at. I think the resort does an amazing job at maintaining a space that's ripe for insect life— we are staying on an island after all, so it's to be expected. There were occasionally baby geckos hanging around the walls of the toilet area but they are always harmless and if anything help to deter other pests from the area. For anyone who really can't deal, some of the less expensive rooms and suites do have indoor bathrooms that look just as nice.&lt;/p&gt;

To the left of the mirror is a spacious lounge area, outfitted with the same plush pillows as the couch indoors. After building up an appetite from swimming we'd enjoy our room service out here before heading right back to the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The food at SALA certainly ranks in my top hotel food experiences, and was on par with what I would expect for a resort. Their breakfast, which was inclusive with our rate, consists of both a vast breakfast buffet &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; your choice of a made-to-order entree from their menu. I ordered the salmon bagel which seemed to be one of their most popular choices at breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/23.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The buffet included a cereal/yogurt/granola bar at one end of the room, a hot food bar at the other, a vegetarian/mezze and cold cut station in the middle, a fruit stand, and a toast station with a vast array of spreads to choose from. That's not including the drinks where in addition to your choice between their signature teas (roselle and lemongrass) they also offered vegetable tonics in shot form and — the crème de la crème — a complimentary bloody mary bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/24.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We took advantage of room service a couple of times during our stay— and I have to admit I actually preferred the room service meals I ordered to the meal we ate when we actually ventured down to the restaurant for dinner. For room service I ordered their lamb meatballs one day and their open faced steak sandwich the next, both of which were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/20.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The menu options are expanded if you physically go to the restaurant for dinner. I would characterize the majority of the menu as a modernized spin on classic Thai dishes. We ordered their fancy version of Miang Kham and a curry dish and while both were good— I could pay a fraction of the price for the same dish at the local street stalls in our neighborhood in Bangkok. So for me the highlights of their menu were the more distinctly western dishes that I can't easily get elsewhere in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;It's funny, since I normally stay in hotels with cozy little rooms, I find myself hanging out in the common areas more often. This was not the case at the SALA Phuket. With our own private pool and outdoor lounging area &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; room service available, we had little reason to leave the privacy of our suite outside of going to breakfast. That said, there are some really nice facilities here that I would've taken more advantage of if we had a longer stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/25.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;There's a small but clean on-site gym on the hotel grounds with a few machines and hand-weight racks. When I saw it I definitely thought to myself &quot;I'm totally going to work out here&quot; but then I went back to my suite and drank a glass of wine instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/27.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;In the same area as the gym there's also a hair salon, spa, and a sauna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/29.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The resort's restaurant has both an indoor and outdoor area, with plenty of lounge seating and a roof deck. There's also two communal pools. The restaurant and pool are located right by the property's private beach. Compared to other beaches across Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, it's not particularly noteworthy but it is clean and peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;We didn't have too much interaction with hotel staff outside from check-in/out and food service but everyone we interacted with was really pleasant. I was also really impressed with their turndown service— aside from turning down the sheets they also come and set up mosquito repellant lights by your bed and also in the outdoor bathroom area, as well as leave you a bottle of one of their homemade teas to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/32.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/33.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;In addition, because we stayed during my birthday, the hotel sent a complimentary chocolate cake to our suite! It was super fudge-y and surprisingly big (I thought they'd send, like, a slice but it was the whole damn cake). I really appreciated the thoughtful touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The SALA Phuket is conveniently located very close to the airport, in an area with a few other resorts like the Renaissance Phuket and JW Marriott Phuket. There's not much to do within walking distance, and no real reason to venture out to the immediate area around the resort. I didn't mind this since I wanted to justify the cost of the resort by spending a lot of time &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; it, and there was little temptation to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
You would definitely need to hire a car or cab to come and take you to many of the popular sites on the island.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/34.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I'm genuinely surprised that a resort of this size seems so inaccessible for wheelchair users. At the very least our suite was: the entrance requires going up a short flight of steps, there's another short step elevating the outdoor bathroom area from the pool, and then a narrow walkway between the pool's edge and the entrance to the bedroom. They may have other suites that are more accessible but I haven't seen it advertised anywhere. Also, I can't recall any paved ramps for accessing the private beach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/sala/35.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I would recommend SALA Phuket as a &quot;starter&quot; resort for folks like me who aren't quite sold yet on the resort experience and want to try it out for a reasonable price. While $250/night is definitely no chump change, when considering resorts in Phuket, SALA is definitely one of the more accessible venues— and it's a good deal when taking into consideration the space, private pool, and inclusive breakfast. If you're still not convinced you can take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theinnbox.co/200-dollars-airbnb-new-york-city/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;how far $200 would get you in New York City&lt;/a&gt; for a comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
To save even more money you could go for one of their balcony suites, sans pool, which start at a little over $100/night in low season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While I can't see myself doing the resort thing for every beach trip, I'm definitely considering staying at other SALA locations throughout Thailand. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&amp;amp;cid=1801609&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=1624710&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Ko Samui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&amp;amp;cid=1801609&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=209973&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Khao Yai&lt;/a&gt; locations are particularly tempting. I love that the design is slightly different in each location but still has that mix of romance and modernity that is distinct to the SALA brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Sunlight sparkles across the water on Gwangan Beach and reflects off the bright, white marble walls of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=1&amp;amp;cid=1801609&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=2962286&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Hotel 1&lt;/a&gt; in Busan. The resulting effect makes it feel like you're floating amongst the clouds— it's a modern, minimalist take on a hotel in Heaven. There's even free snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
While it's the trendy marble aesthetic that draws you in, it's the clever and fun details like cozy plaid robes, stuffed animal pillows, and smart layouts that seal the deal— and keep the minimalist vibe from feeling full mausoleum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
This hotel is probably one of my favorite &quot;finds&quot;, and I truly mean &quot;find&quot; as I didn't come across it until my third or fourth intense research session looking for places to stay in Busan. Nothing was really speaking to me until I came across a photo of a girl in a white marble room, with the brilliant blue sea behind her. A white marble hotel? I whispered a small prayer to the hotel pricing gods and clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The hotel is fairly straight-forward to reach via public transit from Busan station: just hop on the 41 bus and it will practically take you to the hotel's front steps. After a 40 minute ride you'll get off at a bus stop just a couple of small blocks away from the hotel, which sits right on the coast of Gwangan Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Upon entering the hotel, you'll be asked to take off your shoes. This is a practice we abide by at home but which I'd never encountered in a hotel before. The no-shoes policy supported the hotel's stark, clean, and almost museum-like vibe. Plus sliding around on the marble tiled floors in socks felt pretty good. Upon check-in we were given our room key and directed to the storage lockers for shoes to the right of the lobby. The room key also allows you to easily lock and unlock your designated shoe cubby. Pretty advanced, TBH. With our shoes stored away we padded over to the elevator to head up to our room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Hotel 1 is unique because it offers rooms at three separate tiers for different types of budgets and travelers. There are &quot;capsule&quot; style rooms that come with either single beds or bunks, then there are the mid-tier &quot;slim&quot; rooms that are ideal for couples who can get cozy, and lastly the &quot;mansion&quot; tier rooms which are more spacious and offer a sense of luxury and expansive views. In addition to the size tiers there's also small price difference between rooms with a beach versus a city view. It is 100% worth paying for a beach view room. Later I will show you exactly which rooms you'll want to request for the best view.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/04.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We decided to opt for the slim room instead of splurging on a mansion. Partially to save a little bit of money and also out of curiosity for how they would pack everything in to such a narrow and small space. Plus as former New Yorkers, small space living was nothing we weren't used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
&quot;Slim&quot; was no exaggeration. The room was as wide as the bed, and the shower, toilet, and sink all take up about half of the bed's width, with the other half serving as your hallway. Because the bed is placed on an elevated platform the room takes advantage of storage underneath it, and uses that platform as a &quot;chair&quot; for a small desk that is positioned behind the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/05.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/06.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We had just enough room for our two large bags, which we stored at the end of the bed platform, and placed smaller bags on the desk. We could've placed our luggage on the available space by the window but we liked having that space free for us to relax by. Speaking of that window...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The view really sealed the deal for me. Whether it was sunrise, cloudy (when these photos were taken), sunny, or nighttime it was like staring out into a real life postcard. We were lucky to have the most perfectly positioned room at our tier, with a window that sticks out a little bit and is angled towards the main crescent of the beach, and the skyscrapers across the water. I've highlighted the rooms with the best views below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/09.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you look at the facade of the hotel you'll see that the middle section extrudes. If you book a &quot;mansion&quot; class room then you want to book the rooms that occupy that extruded space and will give you a full panoramic view, or a corner room on the right side of the hotel (if you are standing across the street facing the hotel). If you are booking a slim or capsule room than you want to book the room on the right side of the extrusion. Any other room on the ocean view side will still give you a nice view of the water and Gwangan Bridge (which has a light show at night) but the angled windows will offer a more panoramic view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The room also comes supplied with a MUJI blow dryer and water heater, and an electronic back massager, stored under your bed. The flatscreen TV is also equipped with a Chromecast so you can mirror videos from your phone. Then there's the plaid flannel &quot;robes&quot;. It was a nice departure from the usual fluffy white hotel robe, which you'd probably expect considering the aesthetics of the place, but the red plaid injected a burst of color and personality. They were also comfy as hell and I truly think the hotel should make them available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The bathroom is less a self-contained room itself than a series of small boxes. One contains the shower, which although small (there's about 4 square feet of standing room in the slim room shower) still managed to feel luxurious. There's a lovely green and white marble tile used on the shower walls and sink, which at first I was like &quot;hmm that's kind of weird&quot; but then started to slowly fall in love with. Again, it's these small injections of color in this otherwise stark white marble palace that have such a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The other cool thing about the shower is that the rainbath faucet is directly built in to the ceiling, which really sells that sense of immersion than rainbaths try to offer. The shower UI (Can we call it that? Can I make that a thing?) is also pleasantly straight forward, and in addition to the rainbath, and handheld shower head mode, there's also a normal faucet mode ideally for rinsing sandy beach feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The toilet is located in a separate self contained room next to the shower. There's not too much to say about that. There's a mirror in the room for some reason, and a cute white radio that doesn't get the best signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The sink, which is sandwiched between the door and the toilet room, appears small but packs a surprising amount of surface and storage space. My only complaint is that it does a get a little dark in the sink area because the bathroom and shower stalls are blocking the light from the windows. However, as if the hotel is aware of this, there is a small stand mirror on the desk by the bed which gets unobstructed light on the ocean side of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Hotel 1 has some fun common areas to explore. The first floor houses the pantry area (more on that later) with some stadium seating facing the water. The seating and pillows are accentuated by cute, fluffy stuffed animals to lean on. This dining area is branded as the &quot;Byul Bed Cafe&quot;.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/20.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This same motif is present on the second floor of the hotel, which includes more traditional dining seating and seating options for groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/21.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The top floor houses an exposed roof deck with a generous amount of patio seating, but perhaps because of the rainy and not entirely warm April weather, it was pretty dead up there during our stay. The deck is supposedly open between 6pm and midnight but we were able to access it during the day— and when we did try to go at night it was a total ghost town. I imagine it's probably more lively during the summer, otherwise the hotel could do a better job of making it an inviting space and encouraging guests to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/22.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;We didn't have too much interaction with the staff, but everyone was polite and friendly. The staff may not be the most proficient in English, which is understandable as it seems like the hotel doesn't receive too many western guests, but they will try their best to answer any questions you have. If you're patient and not a jerk, it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The food situation at Hotel 1 was both kind of cool, and kind of perplexing. What is cool is that there's a whole big pantry area with snacks that are &lt;i&gt;unlimited&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; with your stay for the taking, including ice cream and juice. The only items that you have to pay for are instant noodles and beer. I think this is especially great for travelers on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/23.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The less cool part was that the hotel offers a breakfast buffet in the mornings for $9 per person but the offerings are... pretty weak. You still need to go to that same pantry area to get your food, but the only difference is there's a few muffins and other types of baked goods set out. The options were about as varied as the grab-and-go options at your local Starbucks. Maybe it was slim pickings because we arrived on the later half of the breakfast service but... I can't imagine what I saw being worth the $9. On the other hand, if you need to eat early there aren't too many places open before 11AM in the immediate area, although there is a mini-mart next door, so pick your poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The hotel is in a very central area on Gwangan beach, one of the two major beaches in Busan. While Haeundae is the more popular beach, I actually preferred the vibe of Gwangan. It was definitely more picturesque— as you get the view looking out towards the buildings near Haeundae rather being amongst them, and it was a little quieter and less crowded. Having been to both I also noticed that many of the bars and restaurants in Haeundae also have a branch in Gwangan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/24.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Gwangan was also a better base for us to visit the main sights we came to see in Busan, like Taejongdae Park, Jagalchi Fish Market, and Gamcheon Cultural Village, as its closer to them than Haeundae. Public transit, whether by bus or metro line, was also super accessible from Hotel 1. It was probably a five minute walk &lt;i&gt;at most&lt;/i&gt; to the nearest stop for either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Hotel 1 does have an elevator and claims to have rooms with in-room accessibility. I will say from my experience that the &quot;slim&quot; rooms do not seem wheelchair friendly, so I would avoid that tier and also inquire directly with the hotel to make sure the room you're booking is accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hotel1/25.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I highly recommend for any visitors to Busan to stay at Hotel 1.
I appreciate that they have room options for every budget. If you're traveling solo, go for the capsule rooms. If you're a couple, get cozy in a slim room, if you're a group of friends then go for the mansions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Hotel 1 has such a fresh, youthful vibe that stills feels classy and upscale. Come for the white marble aesthetic, stay and fall in love with all the clever little details.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotel.muji.com/shenzhen/en/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;MUJI Hotel&lt;/a&gt; provides a ‘just enough’ stay in Shenzhen, the most cyberpunk city of China. MUJI’s minimalism is a true contrast to the city’s modern copy and paste development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Finding the hotel was not a straightforward task. Beware, at the time of writing, Google Maps has the incorrect location. Additionally, the hotel happens to be inside a mall so you won’t be able to see it from the street. If coming by car, there is a loading curb right in front of the entrance. However, it was easier for drivers to pick up and drop off out on the main street of the mall. Like a lot of new malls in China, only a third of the stores in the mall were open. If you’re coming in from the front doors, go up the escalators to the second floor and then take the hallway to the left and exit. The hotel is right outside the doors, across from a Sony store. You’ll be greeted with relief and the iconic signage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Check in itself was easy. Make sure to bring the credit card you booked with and your passport. The front desk staff speaks both Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) and English. They honored my request for a top floor room. The hotel is minimally decorated throughout with only a few indoor plants and floral arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The BGM that plays in all MUJI stores follows you wherever you go. You truly do get the feeling you are staying inside the store. The room numbers shine brightly against the wooden hallways. To unlock your room, tap the key card against the sensor lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I booked the most affordable room since I was staying by myself. There are 5 different room types: A, B, C, D, and E, each increasing in size and amenities. Despite the five levels, the most expensive room tops out at $400 and still follows the 'just enough' ethos. In my Type A room, there was a full length mirror to my right and a closet with a robe, 2 pairs of slippers, a safe, and clothes drying rack to the left of the entrance. Turning the corner from the small hallway, I see the bed and armchair areas and become smitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/02_Bed_A.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/02_Bed_B_b.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The bed is a platform frame MUJI bed with their wonderfully firm MUJI mattress and attached is nightstand on each side. The perfectly fluffed blanket made it extra inviting to go to bed. Across from the bed, there was also a TV and a desk with a concealed lamp inside the upper shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/02_Bed_C.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Feast your eyes upon the most MUJI Hotel amenities shelf! Inside the cabinet underneath is an empty mini fridge. On top, for your use is a MUJI water kettle, bone china coffee and tea cups, instant drip coffees (one caffeinated, one not), and rooibos tea. Although I own most of these products in my home, it was such a joy to see them all together and use them all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/02_Bed_D.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/02_Bed_E_b.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
By the window is an armchair, small coffee table, and ottoman. This was my favorite part of the room. I was still jet lagged during my stay, so I woke up early to make a MUJI drip coffee and drank it in the morning light. I usually find hotel armchairs unappealing, but the MUJI armchair and ottoman felt soft yet supportive. Like so, I have now added their modular sofas to my furniture wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The only piece of art in the room is the minimal wood art above the armchair. Instead of hanging large art pieces, the hotel chooses to prominently feature the materials making up the walls of the room themselves. The materials for the rooms were sourced from traditional Chinese homes. There is finished wood, a mat texture, and grey concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
It would’ve been nice if there was a view beyond the room, but alas you are in a mall in a newly developed area, so there is only the concrete rooftop or the street to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Finally, there is the iconic Naota Fukasawa CD player with BGM loaded up. My room had BGM CD 7, but you can borrow any of their CDs from the front desk. While you listen to MUJI BGM, you can page through the MUJI brand book. There is a copy of it in every room and you can borrow one in English if you want to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Visiting the hotel is a great way to 'try before you buy' any MUJI products you are curious about. In the hotel guidebook, there is a list of items to you borrow from the front desk including their aroma humidifier. Another list tells you can take as keepsakes from your time at the hotel. These items are: the 2 house slippers, 2 toothbrushes, the bathroom vanity kit, black gel pen, coffees, and the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The bathroom in my room did not have any windows and was underwhelming. In comparison to the rest of the room, it lacks the same amount of finesse. I was a disappointed to see my bathroom only had a shower stall. I had been on my feet for a good part of four days and was looking forward to a good soak. Upon second look of the website, it’s clear only the higher tier rooms D and E had fuller bathrooms with tubs. It’s listed as a feature of those rooms, but I had assumed all mid-tier hotel rooms had come with a bathtub these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I will say though the Japanese Toto Washlet was nice. The toilet had its own door which would be a great bonus when having to share a room. Inside the vanity kit you can take home is a travel sized toothpaste, make-up pads, q-tips, and 2 shower caps. You won't be able to take little bottles of soap home since the bathrooms are outfitted with big MUJI soap dispensers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The third floor of the hotel hosts shared amenities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/04_Commons_A.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The lobby features a library with design books you can read. There are also 3 meeting rooms you can book at cost on this floor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/04_Commons_B_b.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;There is a gym with some work out machines, towels, and bottled waters. This is minimal as far as hotel gyms go. No pool, sauna, classes, or staff actively attending the share amenities area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Service was all right. The staff was polite during our interactions, but did not go above or beyond unless responding to a request. They did keep my luggage safe the day I checked out and went off to explore Shenzhen, but that is a perk of staying with any hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/05_Diner_A.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/05_Diner_C.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The hotel only has one eatery, the MUJI Diner. It's decorated much like the standalone MUJI Cafes in Asias with beautiful kitchenware objects. The reception area of the diner also has a small library and bar. One side of the diner shares a wall with the store, so there are books on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/muji/05_Diner_D.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The hours of the diner are 6:30 to 23:00. Breakfast is included with your booking, but you may also have lunch, dinner, and drinks there later in the day. I only had breakfast at the diner. The diner was empty at 8:00 when I showed up and got more packed closer to 9:00. It opens at 6:30 for breakfast. The way it works is that you pick a set breakfast: Chinese, Japanese, or Western. You are limited to 1 set breakfast per morning. There is also a buffet for condiments, rice, curry, miso soup, bread, small pastries, fruits, and drinks. This was unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The included breakfast is nice and does work in their ethos of providing guests with a grounding stay in the city for their visit. The food was cooked all right, but also was nothing special. It is on the level of what a home cook could make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Store&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The hotel is attached to a 2 story MUJI store, of course. The store takes up half of the property spanning across the 2nd and 3rd floors. If you didn’t bring a MUJI outfit, you can buy one here for your obligatory photo in front of the sign! There is a Found MUJI section, Idée section, books, PLANTS, and plenty of clothing. Found MUJI is a curated section of MUJI like products not created by company and Idée is their more colorful sister brand inspired by nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Depending on your trip’s itinerary, I would look up prices across different countries for MUJI. I made the mistake of not doing so and paid more than what I would have in Hong Kong for the same merchandise. All the merchandise found in this store are the same things stocked in MUJI Asia branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Take inventory of what you cannot buy at home first! I picked up a pair of shoes, as many planters as I could carry, and pajamas. There are not any exclusive MUJI Hotel store items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The hotel is located in Futian District. Outside of the mall, the area is mostly residential and commercial buildings. You would need to take the metro or a cab to for Shenzhen activities. For example, the famous Huaqiangbei electronics street is 2.5 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;If you are reading this post, I suspect you may be interested in seeing the new Design Society building! It is 4.7 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The MUJI hotel in Shenzhen is accessible. A driver should be able to drop off guests at the front door and there is an elevator which guests can use to access all floors. Show your driver the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.muji.com.cn/cn/store/feature/mujihotel/shenzhen/#access&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;address on the website&lt;/a&gt; to make sure they can find the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
MUJI fans will definitely enjoy their stay here, despite my nitpicks about the bathrooms and the breakfast. It’s the closest a fan can get to living in a store. The prefab homes and huts are quite the pretty penny, and only available in Japan after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
MUJI curious can stay at the hotel to try out a good portion of their products before committing to the just enough no brand lifestyle. One night would be enough to get a sense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
I would not recommend staying here if you’re not at least curious about MUJI. For a few more dollars, you can find alternative accommodations in Shenzhen that have the usual hotel amenities MUJI has edited away. I was personally over the moon and didn’t want to check out of the hotel after my stay. However, you’ll have to consider that I have friends who use the scale of “from 0 to Mintlodica, how much are you a MUJI nerd?” and on this scale, I max out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Providence. The biggest city in America's smallest state. It's a known creative hub; home to one of the country's best art and design schools and a history in textile manufacturing. It's the perfect weekend getaway on the east coast, particularly in the summer season when the surrounding waters warm up and locals and visitors alike embrace the salty seas. Foodies will also appreciate the unending supply of American restaurants, from fine dining spots downtown to the burgeoning brunch scene in the city's more youthful neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The Dean is often described as New England's answer to the Ace Hotel and it's not surprising to see why: The Dean is also home to a hip coffeeshop, bar, and restaurant, making it more than just a hotel but a place for people in Providence to hang out. The rooms are minimally decorated but with classic east coast twists like off-white walls, golden fixtures, and dark industrial furniture; all of which are an ode to the city's manufacturing background. The building's former life as a strip club and brothel also adds hidden meaning to the hotel's cheeky tagline &quot;Sleep with The Dean&quot;. The Dean offers affordable bunk rooms for groups of friends as well as rooms for solo-travelers. We stayed here in a double room for a long weekend in 2015 and loved it's central, downtown location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;The Dean Hotel offers facilities for disabled guests.&lt;/p&gt;

The warehouse space gets amazing light, features beautiful art and ceramics, and some amazing tile work, like that red shower which is giving me 80's gym vibes, in the best possible way. The property is located in Olneyville, a quiet arts neighborhood that's less central but still only a seven minute drive away from downtown. Dye House Lofts has a three-night minimum stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I can't get over the dreamy, cobalt blue kitchen cupboards, slanted ceilings, and candy-colored exterior that make this Airbnb seem straight out of a storybook. The host, Chip, operate four separate Airbnbs out of this building but this top floor unit with its half-moon windows and pyramid alcoves is our favorite. The Airbnb is located in a safe, diverse, and thus far un-gentrified neighborhood near both Federal Hill and Downtown— where Chip has lived for over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This bright, modern Airbnb is operated by a jewelry designer who has lived in Providence for the past twelve years. We love how the space is accented with interesting, artful pieces like chunky, knitted throws on the bed or vintage tufted mustard colored chairs in the living room. The bathroom also features a steam-room shower. Even though the Airbnb is big enough for four, at its price point it's also a great deal for a couple or pair of friends. The unit is located in the city's Armory neighborhood, walking distance to several hip cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot; class=&quot;f6 i pb4 light-silver&quot;&gt;This Airbnb is located on the ground floor, however entrance to the building requires going up a small stoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;This Airbnb is our pick for families and large groups. The Airbnb can comfortably accommodate 5 (but can squeeze in up to 7) which makes it a steal at its price point. This is also a great example of how furniture and decor can add so much personality into a space with relatively straight-forward architecture. White boxes and a standardized kitchen are brought to life with colorful textiles, clashing patterns, tiny trinkets and large sculptures. The home was originally built in 1855 but renovated last year in 2017 and is operated by a mother and daughter duo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, I'm not a huge museum person but I do love small-sized institutions that are approachable and not overwhelming. The art museum affiliated with the Rhode Island School of Design is just that. It's small but covers a wide breadth from classical to contemporary art, and the buildings that form the museum are just as gorgeous as the works housed within. It's a solid way to spend an afternoon and afterwards take a stroll around the nearby campus and take in all the colorful, adorable houses. Admission to the museum is free on Sundays.

&lt;p&gt;About an hour's drive out of Providence is the port-town of Newport. The town can be best described as a J-crew catalog come to life but that doesn't mean it's without charm. Kick back with a beer and some stuffed quahogs on the pier or check out the International Yacht Restoration School (IYRS) where you can view a yacht currently in the process of restoration and peep all the interesting vintage artifacts they found onboard scattered throughout the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f4 mb1 lh-title mt0-ns mt3&quot; style=&quot;font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'&quot;&gt;Pick fruits at Sweet Berry Farm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all love farmer's markets but those of us who live in urban enclaves rarely get to pick out the goods ourselves. Sweet Berry Farm, located halfway between Providence and Newport, is known for their 'picking season' which runs from June to November. You get charged by the basket and are allowed to roam the fields and harvest your own fruits. Very IRL Stardew Valley! We went during strawberry and raspberry season and had so much fun trying to pick the 'best' fruits. But beware— hands and shirts will get stained so maybe keep your summer whites in the suitcase for this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a short drive from Sweet Berry Farm is Norman Bird Sanctuary, which is also home to seven miles of hiking trails. Since you'll be driving a lot to get around in Providence, it's definitely worth a pit stop to stretch your legs. The sanctuary's most famous trail is Hanging Rock, which is a ridge trail that leads up to a seventy feet tall overlook, where you'll be rewarded with sweeping views of the Rhode Island coastline. Admission is $7.00. For folks who are really into the outdoors, you can even stay in an adorable &lt;a href=&quot;http://normanbirdsanctuary.org/farmhouse/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Farmhouse&lt;/a&gt; on the sanctuary grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dorrance is the exact opposite of the cozy, teeny tiny little cocktail bars I usually find more romantic. Yet with its tall ceilings, stained glassed windows, and dramatic curtains it still manages to make me feel a little wistful. This downtown cocktail bar and restaurant is located in an old Federal Reserve building and gets pretty lively on the weekend nights. Order a craft cocktail and head upstairs to the balcony level for people watching and privacy— or, if it's not already occupied, you can try nabbing the couch in the building's old vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many new brunch restaurants that have cropped up in recent years in Providence's hip Federal Hill neighborhood, Julian's has been a neighborhood establishment for over twenty years. Their signature also happens to be my favorite brunch dish: Eggs Benedict. Take your pick of seven different varieties and one of their creative hash sides. If Benedicts aren't your thing the restaurant also offer you eggs wrapped, poached in shakshuka, scrambled into a pizza, or fried into an omelet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mt4-ns mt3 mb4-ns mb3&quot; src=&quot;/images/calma/splash.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4 f4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
A ten minute motorbike ride outside of central Ubud is the residential village Kutuh Kaja, where at night the skies are dotted with more stars than many of us city dwellers are used to seeing, and by day large swaths of rice fields dominate the scenery. Here is where you'll find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?cid=1801609&amp;amp;pcs=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;hid=1258271&quot; targt=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Calma Ubud&lt;/a&gt;, the most accurate picture of a boutique hotel if there ever was one, and one of the best values in Ubud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Calma Ubud consists of ten individual rooms set in what feels like a very private complex of villas. Operating at such a small scale the hotel is able to provide a high quality experience for guests at a lower cost than many of the larger resorts dotting the Ubud area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;anchor&quot; class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Checking In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Checking in at the Ubud was a fairly straight forward process, although finding the hotel for the first time is a little tricker— keep those eagle eyes out because it's very easy to drive by as the hotel blends so seamlessly into the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/6.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The Calma's lobby is open aired and elegantly decorated, a little taste of what's to come when you enter the compound. We signed up for a spa package during check-in and then were guided through a few wooden doors to our suite, where we were greeted with complimentary mojitos as a welcome drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
We had booked a &quot;Superior Room&quot; and honestly I was a little surprised at the size of the bedroom, which was smaller than I had expected. The Calma Ubud has ten rooms but six different room types, and it gets kind of confusing to keep track of the hierarchy here. I think I had mistaken the &quot;Superior Room&quot; for the &quot;Superior Double or Twin&quot; which appears a little more spacious in photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
Nonetheless, it wasn't a huge disappointment and because of the large bathroom and easy access to the hotel's common areas, we never felt cramped or like there wasn't enough room for the two of us. Since Ubud is also packed with sights to see and we had a relatively short time there (two days) we weren't spending that much time in our room anyway. Our room also included a little patio in front with two chairs, straw blind for privacy, and buddha statue out front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
The room itself was very minimal in decoration. I loved the carved white wooden headboard, jade colored side tables, and vibrant woven rug, but I'm not going to lie I wasn't super into the minimalist wooden wall art on display in the room. Since the room is already so sparse I would've loved to see some color on the walls in addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt; Bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;As usual, the bathroom is always a highlight for me and the Calma Ubud is no exception. The open shower area has a skylight that fills the room with the most wonderful warm ambiance in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fn center mb3 mb4-ns tc&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/7.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
There was plenty of counter space around the sink for all of our things and the landscape mirror was perfect for two girls to get ready at the same time. The bathroom also has a drying rack in addition to a ladder-style towel rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 w-50-ns pr1-ns mb1 mb2-ns&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;Common Areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The center-piece of the Calma is the infinity pool overlooking rice fields in the back. Due to the hotel's small size the pool was never over-crowded during our stay. It's the perfect place to spend the afternoon and chill out with a happy hour drink after seeing sights all day. On the other side of the pool is also a quieter wooden deck area with a few lounge chairs overlooking the fields if you're looking for some privacy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fl w-100 mb3 mb4-ns&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/calma/18.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;The pool is connected to the hotel's restaurant, which is tastefully decorated with a variety of seating options: bar, coffee tables with sofas, hammocks, a large communal table, and more traditional cafe-style tables for two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;I feel like I had very mixed experiences with the service at Calma Ubud. There were certain staff members who went above and beyond during our stay, like the front desk attendant who went around asking the other staff members for small bills so that I could break a large bill to pay my motorcycle driver. Or the friendly young man who would drive the hotel's van to drop us off in central Ubud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;On the flip side, breakfast our first day was somewhat stressful. Knowing that our tour guide was coming to pick us up at a certain time, I wanted to make sure I was able to get breakfast, which is included free with your stay. I think the restaurant must've been understaffed that day because it took over twenty minutes before someone was able to take my order. We ended up having to ask them to package breakfast to go in order to leave the hotel on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3 pb4-ns&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;In addition when we booked our spa services it wasn't clear to us that we had essentially booked a 'couples' treatment when what we wanted were two individual treatments. This meant we shared a lot of the same time and resources but without any discount on the price of the services. Despite this, I would still recommend getting a massage or bath at the spa if that's something that interests you— ultimately the price is so much more affordable than getting similar treatments in the U.S. that it's hard to complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;The Food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4-ns pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;Despite my complaints about the slow service in the kitchen, I have to say the food itself was amazing. The strawberry crepes we had for breakfast the first day were some of the best I've ever had. I think it's super impressive albeit ambitious that their free breakfast is made to order from a decently varied menu, considering most hotels with free breakfast will either set out a buffet or limit their menu to two or three options at most. The free breakfast also includes your choice of juice or a smoothie in addition to tea and/or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you're looking for a quiet and tranquil area to stay in Ubud you can't get much better than the Calma. However, the hotel isn't walking distance to any restaurants or sights. You'll need to take the hotel shuttle to downtown Ubud which is free if you go according to their shuttle schedule or around $6 each way (for the whole party) outside. Our schedule pretty much never worked out with the shuttle so we ended up paying for the shuttle a few times, with the return trip always being a little cheaper because you can just find a driver in Ubud to take you back for less.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm still kind of torn on whether or not I would've liked to stay in Central Ubud. On the one hand, it's nice to be close to all the restaurants, shops, and nightlife. On the other hand, it's also nice to be in a more relaxing environment with the space to stretch out.&lt;/p&gt;

While there are ground-floor rooms available at the Calma, there are steps all over the hotel grounds that it's hard for me to recommend this place for wheelchair users. With the exception of the upper-floor suites these tend to be short flights, but they are there separating the rooms from the pathway to the restaurant, from the restaurant to the pool, from the pool to the spa area and the lounge/deck area on the other side of the pool. There are also shallow steps around the various thresholds and doorways leading to the suites from the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;f3 pb2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold';&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pb4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
If you really want to go &quot;all out&quot; during your stay to Ubud there are definitely bigger, more reputable resorts that are worth checking out. However, if you are keen to stick to a budget but still want to stay somewhere inspiring and relaxing then I think the Calma Ubud is one of the best options in the area. It's price point is simply lower than average for the quality they deliver and as long as you keep that in mind and overlook a few flaws, you'll be happy with your stay.&lt;/p&gt;
