Last week we covered how Austin is the king city of Airbnbs in terms of quantity and quality. Well, you could say the same for Paris with its endless supply of top notch boutique hotels. There are an almost overwhelming amount of options, all with their own character and many at a surprisingly affordable price for a city with such an expensive reputation. We've narrowed down our top picks to help you find the perfect Parisian place for you.

<p class="tc f6 light-silver i mt4 mb4">Rates are based on a one-night search for January 2018.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For living like a local — <a href="http://www.lespiaules.com/" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Les Piaules</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $30/Night</span></p>

Due to the recent proliferation of out-of-the-box hostel chains in Europe, it’s always refreshing to come across independently owned hostels that are done well. Les Pialues is located in the up and coming neighborhood of Belleville, a bit farther from many of Paris’ main tourist attractions. The hostel features a custom designed bunk bed intended to improve and reinvent the standard hostel experience. There’s also a poppin’ bar downstairs for guests and locals alike. Shared rooms start as low as $30 and private rooms at $102.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Les Piaules is wheelchair accessible and has roll-in showers.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For families — <a href="https://en.astotel.com/hotel/monterosa-en/overview" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Hôtel Monterosa</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $133/Night</span></p>

Monterosa is the first hotel we’ve featured on The InnBox that’s belongs to a chain, but to be fair the chain in question, Astotel, only operates in Paris. They run 16 hotels all of which are somewhat similar in their design, highly reviewed, and kind on the budget. I personally stayed at the Monterosa and thought it had a great location, being walking distance to both Pigalle and Saint Georges metro stations. The decor is modern and clean, continental breakfast is provided, and we spent countless nights just hanging out drinking tea in the little lobby cafe.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Hotel Monterosa has an elevator but does not have facilities specifically for handicapped guests.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For New Yorkers at heart — <a href="https://hotelpanache.com" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Hotel Panache</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $143/Night</span></p>

</div>
The building that houses Hotel Panache has no right angles— it’s triangular shape gives it something in common with the iconic Flatiron building in New York City, and thus that’s where Panache’s industrial designer drew her inspiration. The Flatiron was finished in 1902, so at Panache you’ll find many examples of art nouveau, the major art movement on the time. While each room is uniquely decorated (including one with this <a href="https://www.cole-and-son.com/en/collection-fornasetti/wallpaper-77/7024/">malachite wallpaper</a> I’d sell my unborn child for), they all feature a custom headboard inspired by Thonet bentwood chairs. New Yorkers who’ve spent a lot of time in the Flatiron neighborhood will feel right at home here. We've also heard a rumor that if you are traveling with small children they will bring a miniature teepee to your room.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Second and third floors are accessible by elevator and there are facilities for wheelchair users. Hotel Panache rates are typically above $300 but you can often find discounted rates for under $250.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For design nerds — <a href="http://www.coqhotelparis.com/en/" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">COQ Hotel</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $158/Night</span></p>

</div>
COQ is a reference to both the bird and an acronym for “community of quality”. That quality comes through in the curated furnishings like wooden flooring from Limogues and vintage Kilim rugs from Turkey and Moldova. The hotel, which was designed to invoke the sense of being in a family home, also has a dark and muted, almost masculine vibe— a welcome departure from the more clinical white rooms that have become on-trend as of late. The hotel also has a greenhouse and a small courtyard with a chicken coop.

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For minimalists — <a href="https://hotel-lapin-blanc.com/" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Le Lapin Blanc</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $166/Night</span></p>

</div>
Meaning “the white rabbit”, Le Lapin Blanc is an ode to Alice in Wonderland without coming across too twee. The decor is all muted millennial pastels against snowy whites, with interesting details like carpet cut-outs that transition into bathroom tile and geometric tubs. Le Lapin Blanc is located in the Latin Quarter, a stone’s throw away from the Sorbonne as well as the famous bookstore Shakespeare and Company.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Le Lapin Blanc has an elevator but does not have facilities specifically for handicapped guests.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For trendsetters — <a href="https://www.hotelfabric.com/" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Hotel Fabric</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $175/Night</span></p>

</div>
A hotel that’s a little more Hermès than Chanel. Housed in a former textile factory, Hotel Fabric pays tribute to its history through its playful and colorful combinations of patterns and textures, such as the fanciful tile work in the bathrooms. While it’s located in a less touristy area it’s still within walking distance to many of Paris’ major attractions but the real value is in its proximity to the fashionable nightlife and restaurant scene in Oberkampf.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Hotel Fabric has an elevator and wheelchair accessible facilities.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For the honeymoon period — <a href="http://www.hoteldejobo.paris/" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Hotel de JOBO</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $272/Night</span></p>

</div>
The hotel is a homage to the former social and empress of France, Josephine Bonaparte (get it? Jo..Bo?). The decor references Josephine’s tastes, like her fondness for roses or her credit for being the first to sport a leopard print rug. The building, a former convent. features 24 rooms, most of which feature revitalized Directoire-era wallpaper and empire style beds. There’s an undeniable air of romance here, making it perfect for new couples who can’t get enough of each other or time-tested romances looking to rekindle the flame.
