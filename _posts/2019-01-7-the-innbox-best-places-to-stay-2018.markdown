<p class="f4 pb3 pb4-ns" style="max-width: 650px; margin: auto;">In 2018 I spent 119 nights outside of my home. That's nearly a third of my year spent at 65 unique places to stay, including hotels, hostels, airbnbs, resorts, guesthouses, boats, tubes, treehouses... the list goes on. Reflecting back on the year there were quite a few places that have wormed their way into my heart. My homes away from home. The places that kept me inspired, refreshed, and fulfilled.</p>

<p class="pb3 pb4-ns" style="max-width: 650px; margin: auto;">
I've always felt that where you stay when you travel provides the foundation for the rest of your trip. Staying somewhere that makes you uncomfortable or doesn't meet your expectations builds up a sense of stress that will follow you to that beautiful beach or bustling city. Somewhere safe and clean will provide a blank canvas for your other travel experiences to build upon. But what I've learned this year is that a <i>great</i> place doesn't even require a distinction from the rest of your trip. It fits naturally into the scenery you've come to see, and blurs the line between where you explore during the day and where you fall asleep at night. Great places aren't always the most expensive or the most luxurious. They're simply the ones that fit <i>your</i> specific style of traveling the most. The ones that meet the needs you didn't even realize you had. So, based on my personal travels in Asia this past year I've attempted to identify which places exceeded my expectations across nine different categories. I hope you'll find it helpful in identifying not only some great places to stay, but also what's important to <i>you</i> when you travel.

They even send you to a local kopitiam for breakfast!

<b>Why we like it:</b> Treehouse-themed lodgings are becoming a dime a dozen but most fall into the trap of being either far too artificial or having far too few amenities to make the experience actually enjoyable. Birdhouse manages to get it just right, with luxurious tents and decent bathrooms that are embedded right into the lush trees of El Nido. The view doesn't hurt either. <a href="http://theinnbox.co/birdhouse-el-nido-review/" target="new">Read the full review.</a></p>

<b>Why we like it:</b> The Aviary Hotel isn't a huge resort but it packs all the amenities of one into a boutique format. There's a stunning pool and plenty of dining choices: a restaurant, a cafe, and a rooftop cocktail bar to boot. The location is close enough to the action in Siem Reap without being directly in the thick of the nightlife, but what truly helped it cinch the top spot in this category is the five-star service of the staff. <a href="http://theinnbox.co/the-aviary-hotel-siem-reap-review/" target="new">Read the full review.</a></p>

<b>Why we like it:</b> Le Pirate Beach Club may not classify itself as a resort, but I'm considering it one and I think it's the perfect "resort" for people like me who are resort skeptics. It's not ostentatious, in fact the tiny bare beach shacks which serve as your room are downright humble. Yet the seaside location and the kidney-shaped pool which overlooks it feels luxurious, and the intimate size of the property makes it seem quite exclusive, even at the accessible price of $50/night. We spent a whole day chilling and eating snacks by the pool after a disasterous excursion and had zero regrets.</p>

<b>Why we like it:</b> Not only are the pan au chocolates baked fresh every morning, you can order as many of them as you want (along with croissants and other baked goods) and they're served with a trio of homemade jams. That's just the appetizer to your morning meal. The rest of Satri House's menu is composed of a curated mix of restaurant-quality western and Lao dishes (but honestly don't sleep on the Lao offerings). My favorites were the noodle dishes and this one egg-y crepe served with northern sausage. Throughout a three-night stay I never got bored of eating breakfast at the hotel's lovely restaurant which overlooks a Lotus pond, where the flowers are in full bloom every morning. <a href="http://theinnbox.co/satri-house-luang-prabang-laos-review/" target="new">Read more about Satri House.</a></p>

<b>Why we like it:</b> The bathrooms at Treehouse Villas are smartly laid out, wrapping around and behind the bedroom. As you walk through it you first encounter the dramatic bathtub (unfortunately not ideal for two people, but that can be forgiven) followed by the spacious master-bedroom style sinks, open shower area, enclosed toilet room, a vanity, and finally the spacious closet area. The bathroom offers just the right amount of privacy while letting in optimum amounts of light. The place is practically sun-drenched!</p>

<b>Why we like it:</b> Hotel 1 is not the most opulent or visually inspiring place I've stayed this year, but somehow it just checks a lot of boxes for me. It's the perfect storm of affordability, design, amenities, and location. First of all, there are so many different room tiers for different budgets. There are rooms ideal for solo travelers, for groups, for cozy couples, or besties who want to treat themselves. The location couldn't be better as the hotel sits right on quieter Gwangan Beach but provides a beautiful view of bustling Haeundae Beach and it's surrounding skyscrapers. It's also a lot closer to many of the nature and cultural sights in Busan than most of the hotels in Haeundae, such as Taejongdae Park, Jagalchi Fish Market, and Gamcheon Cultural Village. The marble-themed interior is unlike any hotel I've ever stayed in, and somehow works so well with the surrounding blues of the sea and sky outside. <a href="http://theinnbox.co/hotel-1-busan-review/">Read the full review to see why I love this place so much.</a></p>

<b>Why we like it:</b> I suppose it's only fitting that my favorite hotel happens to be located in my favorite place I visited this year. To be honest, I'm not sure how much of my fondness is because of Busan's unique character or because I honestly had no expectations when I traveled there, and all of my recommendations for what to do came from two different South Korean friends who've spent considerable time there. I chose to go to Busan because I thought it'd be nice to see more of South Korea outside of Seoul and I found myself gradually falling in love with the seaside town. Even though it was kind of chilly in April, we were blessed with cerulean waters and bright blue skies. The city was easy to navigate by public transit, and I liked that it was small enough that we could explore at a leisurely pace and still feel like we weren't missing out on anything. There was a perfect mix of food, beautiful nature, and unique cultural sights, which is typically what I look for when I travel. I recognize the irony in that my high praise may raise expectations for this low-key city, but if you're looking for a place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of Seoul, Busan is a two and a half hour train ride worth taking.</p>
