Previously, we've covered how Austin is the <a href="http://theinnbox.co/best-airbnbs-austin-texas/" target="new">king city of Airbnbs</a> in terms of quantity and quality. One could say the same for Paris with its endless supply of conceptual boutique hotels. There are an almost overwhelming amount of options, each with their own character and many at a surprisingly affordable price for a city with such an opulent, expensive reputation. We’ve narrowed down our top picks to help you find the perfect Parisian place for you.

<p class="f6 light-silver i mt4 mb4">Rates are based on a one-night search for January 2018. The Innbox may collect a small share of sales from bookings made through this post, at no extra cost to the reader.</p>

Due to the recent proliferation of out-of-the-box hostel chains in Europe, it’s always refreshing to come across independently owned hostels that are done well. Les Pialues is located in the up and coming neighborhood of Belleville, a bit farther from many of Paris’ main tourist attractions. The hostel features a custom designed bunk bed intended to improve and reinvent the standard hostel experience. There’s also a poppin’ bar downstairs for guests and locals alike. Shared rooms start as low as $30 and private rooms at $102.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Les Piaules is wheelchair accessible and has roll-in showers.</p>

If you like to treat yourself to steakhouse dinners when you travel, look no further than Ao Boeuf Couronné, a hotel adjoined with a renovated steakhouse that was originally built in the 1930's. The hotel is located in the 19th arr., across the street from Park La Villette which itself used to be the site of a large meat market. The interiors are bright and woodsy, although I think they could go a little easy on the wall decals.

</div>
Monterosa is the first hotel we’ve featured on The InnBox that’s belongs to a chain, but to be fair the chain in question, Astotel, only operates in Paris. They run 16 hotels all of which are somewhat similar in their design, highly reviewed, and kind on the budget. I personally stayed at the Monterosa and thought it had a great location, being walking distance to both Pigalle and Saint Georges metro stations. The decor is modern and clean, continental breakfast is provided, and we spent countless nights just hanging out drinking tea in the little lobby cafe.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Hotel Monterosa has an elevator but does not have facilities specifically for handicapped guests.</p>

Originally from the U.K., The Hoxton hotel chain is the brainchild of the former Pret-A-Manger founder and bills itself as an "anti-hotel" (though let's be real... it's a hotel). Its Paris location is its largest and housed inside an 18th century building in the 2nd arr, with 300 year old spiral staircases to boot. Rooms on the fourth floor provide views of the Eiffel Tower. If you can't wait to go to Paris, you can always visit The Hoxton's recently opened Williamsburg and Portland locations or the four other sites that will be opening across the United States over the next couple of years!

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For New Yorkers at heart — <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/madrid-opera.en.html?aid=1452227" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Hotel Panache</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $143/Night</span></p>

<div class="fl w-100 w-50-ns pl1-ns mb3">
<img src="../images/paris/panache2.jpg">
</div>
The building that houses Hotel Panache has no right angles— it’s triangular shape gives it something in common with the iconic Flatiron building in New York City, and thus that’s where Panache’s industrial designer drew her inspiration. The Flatiron was finished in 1902, so at Panache you’ll find many examples of art nouveau, the major art movement on the time. While each room is uniquely decorated (including one with this <a href="https://www.cole-and-son.com/en/collection-fornasetti/wallpaper-77/7024/">malachite wallpaper</a> I’d sell my unborn child for), they all feature a custom headboard inspired by Thonet bentwood chairs. New Yorkers who’ve spent a lot of time in the Flatiron neighborhood will feel right at home here. We've also heard a rumor that if you are traveling with small children they will bring a miniature teepee to your room.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Second and third floors are accessible by elevator and there are facilities for wheelchair users. Hotel Panache rates are typically above $300 but you can often find discounted rates for under $250.</p>

If colorful hostels and hip "anti-hotels" aren't your thing, you might like the more understated elegance of Hôtel Thérèse. The interiors are awash in textured neutrals with pops of turquoise and the dining room is located inside a cozy wine cellar. The rooms are on the small side, though some might prefer to call it "cozy". Hôtel Thérèse is located in Japantown, and is walking distance from the Louvre.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Hôtel Thérèse is wheelchair accessible and has bathrooms with raised toilets, grab rails, and lowered sinks.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For design nerds — <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/community-of-quality.en.html?aid=1452227" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">COQ Hotel</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $158/Night</span></p>

</div>
COQ is a reference to both the bird and an acronym for “community of quality”. That quality comes through in the curated furnishings like wooden flooring from Limogues and vintage Kilim rugs from Turkey and Moldova. The hotel, which was designed to invoke the sense of being in a family home, also has a dark and muted, almost masculine vibe— a welcome departure from the more clinical white rooms that have become on-trend as of late. The hotel also has a greenhouse and a small courtyard with a chicken coop.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Hotel COQ has facilities for disabled guests.</p>

Les Ateliers is a bed and breakfast located in one of Paris' most charming neighborhoods, Montmartre. Each of its three floor-wide suites gives you a stunning view of the Sacré Coeur, and they feature artwork from local artists who sell their wares at the nearby Place du Tertre. The guesthouse also includes a shared kitchen, dining room, and terrace.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Les Ateliers does not appear to have an elevator, but we recommend directly reaching out to the host for more accessibility information.</p>

<p class="f3 pt3 lh-title" style="font-family: 'Gilroy-ExtraBold'">For minimalists — <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/le-lapin-blanc.en.html?aid=1452227" target="_blank" class="link underline-hover orange">Le Lapin Blanc</a><span class="f5 light-silver">&nbsp; &nbsp;Starting at $166/Night</span></p>

</div>
Meaning “the white rabbit”, Le Lapin Blanc is an ode to Alice in Wonderland without coming across too twee. The decor is all muted millennial pastels against snowy whites, with interesting details like carpet cut-outs that transition into bathroom tile and geometric tubs. Le Lapin Blanc is located in the Latin Quarter, a stone’s throw away from the Sorbonne as well as the famous bookstore Shakespeare and Company.
<p class="f6 i light-silver">Le Lapin Blanc has an elevator but does not have facilities specifically for handicapped guests.</p>

Hôtel Monte Cristo is actually the sister property to the aforementioned C.O.Q. Hotel, with interiors courtesy of the same designers. The concept behind the Monte Cristo however, is unsurprisingly a tribute to Alexander Dumas and an attempt to envision the world that an 19th century traveller would experience (from an admittedly very western perspective). The hotel also houses one of Paris' first dedicated rum bars, a homage to Dumas' Caribbean roots.

A hotel that’s a little more Hermès than Chanel. Housed in a former textile factory, Hotel Fabric pays tribute to its history through its playful and colorful combinations of patterns and textures, such as the fanciful tile work in the bathrooms. While it’s located in a less touristy area it’s still within walking distance to many of Paris’ major attractions but the real value is in its proximity to the fashionable nightlife and restaurant scene in Oberkampf.

This art-deco themed hotel was once the apartment home of Duc de Choiseul, a politician during the time of Louis XV. Parisian apartment living inspired the layout of the six different room tiers at the hotel, which are all denoted by a different bright colored wall, thanks to the Milanese designers <a href="http://www.dimorestudio.eu/" target="new">Dimore Studio</a>. When you need to get out of you room you can either walk to the nearby Opera House or venture downstairs to the spa which features a heated pool with hydromassage and counter-current capabilities.

Hotel Parister boasts mid-century modern furniture with velvet finishings, a lovely combination that imbues the hotel's modernity with a sense of warmth. Every single item in the hotel from the bookcases to the coffee tables and ottomans feels like a unique find from a vintage fair, and sits in contrast to the hotel's understated exterior. Some of the hotel's unique offerings include a decadent Sunday brunch and fitness program, including an 18-meter indoor lap pool.

The hotel is a homage to the former social and empress of France, Josephine Bonaparte (get it? Jo..Bo?). The decor references Josephine’s tastes, like her fondness for roses or her credit for being the first to sport a leopard print rug. The building, a former convent. features 24 rooms, most of which feature revitalized Directoire-era wallpaper and empire style beds. There’s an undeniable air of romance here, making it perfect for new couples who can’t get enough of each other or time-tested romances looking to rekindle the flame.
