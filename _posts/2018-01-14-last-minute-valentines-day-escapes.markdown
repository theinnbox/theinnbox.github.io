Yes, I know— Valentine's Day is a manufactured event intended to sell Hallmark cards and chocolate with no real bearing on the health of our relationships. But the fact it falls pretty squarely in the midst of our winter hibernation always makes me excited for an excuse to do *something*, literally *anything* out of the ordinary, whether that's dressing up for a fancy dinner or packing my bags for a weekend escape.

I also find it interesting the ways in which traveling can strengthen our relationships, or at least put them to the test. Whether that's through spending a longer stretch of time than usual with our significant others and friends, working together to navigate an unfamiliar place, or learning more about yourself and what you're capable of on a solo-trip.

So I've put together some low-key ideas on how to celebrate, regardless of your relationship status. Fun fact: I've probably spent more of the past five Valentine's Days with my best friend than my boyfriend— there's really no wrong way to spend it and to be honest nothing sounds more romantic to me than exploring a new city where nobody knows your name.

<p class="f6 light-silver i mb0">As of writing all of the hotels recommended still have availability for the night of February 14th.</p>

This adorable little Bavarian town in eastern Washington looks straight out of a storybook. It's a two hour drive from Seattle and this modern, custom-built Airbnb was only just completed last year. The Airbnb is perfect for a cabin weekend with a group of friends, close to the town for shopping and dining but also with access to nearby ski resorts and hiking trails.

Just a 45 minute drive up from Pacific Coast Highway from L.A. lies the newly re-opened Native Hotel, a series of bungalows formally known as the Malibu Riviera Motel where old Hollywood types like James Dean and Marilyn Monroe wood often escape to. Get in your prerequisite long walks on the beach, brunch at Malibu Farm Cafe, and get your fill of some of the region's best wines before closing out the night in your coastal abode.

Round-trip flights to Nashville from Dallas are as low as $91 if you're flexible enough to fly back on Valentine's Day.

The Catahoula hotel occupies a historic townhouse originally built in 1845 and sits just outside of the French Quarter— close enough to the revelry without being in the thick of the madness.  Start your morning with beignets and coffee, and end the night with an amazing Peruvian dinner and drinks at the hotel's restaurant and Pisco bar.

When I was a little girl growing up in Texas, the San Antonio riverwalk seemed like the most romantic place in the world. Take a night-time cruise amidst rainbow colored lights and then spend your nights at the historic Hotel Havana, originally opened in 1918 by a local groper and recently reopened under the management of the Austin based hotel group Bunkhouse.

The Basecamp Boulder is the perfect HQ for a weekend trip to the   rocky little town 45 minutes outside of Denver. Hike around Chautauqua Park, go shopping on Pearl Street, kick back with a beer at many of the area's local breweries, or literally hang out on the hotel's climbing wall.

A three hour drive/one hour flight east of Chicago is a little town called Galena, with a big Irish influence and the former home of Ulysses S. Grant. The main street is filled with adorable little shops, restaurants, and distilleries. We recommend staying a 20 minute drive across stay lines in Dubuque, Iowa, at The Richards House, a budget friendly bed & breakfast that has all the magic of a Hogwarts common room.

<p class="f6 i light-silver">The Richards House does not specifically state whether or not they have accessible facilities.</p>
